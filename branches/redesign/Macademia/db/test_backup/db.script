INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(1,0,'{{Sociology}}\u000aA virtual community is a social network of individuals who interact through specific media, potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. One of the most pervasive types of virtual community include social networking services, which consist of various online communities.The term virtual community is attributed to the book of the same title by Howard Rheingold, published in 1993. The book, which could be considered a social enquiry, putting the research in the social sciences, discussed his adventures on The WELL and onward into a range of computer-mediated communication and social groups, broadening it to information science. The technologies included Usenet, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), chat rooms and electronic mailing lists; the World Wide Web as we know it today was not yet used by many people. Rheingold pointed out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to such a group.\u000aIntroductionThe traditional definition of a community is of a geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc).  Virtual communities, of course, are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.Early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality, whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the 17th-century, scholars associated with the Royal Society of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.Pears, Iain. 1998. An Instance of the Fingerpost. London: Jonathan Cape. "Community without propinquity", coined by urban planner Melvin Webber in 1963 and "community liberated," analyzed by Barry Wellman in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.Webber, Melvin. 1963. "Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity." Pp. 23-54 in Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land, edited by J. Lowdon Wingo. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. Wellman, Barry. "The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers." American Journal of Sociology 84 (March, 1979): 1201-31.  As well, Benedict Anderson''s Imagined Communities in 1983, described how different technologies, such as national newspapers, contributed to the development of national and regional consciousness among early nation-states.Anderson, Benedict. 1991. Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism. London: Verso.\u000aPurpose of virtual communitiesVirtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups. It does not necessarily mean that there is a strong bond among the members, although Howard Rheingold, author of the book of the same name, mentions that virtual communities form "when people carry on public discussions long enough, with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships".{{cite book}} An email distribution list may have hundreds of members and the communication which takes place may be merely informational (questions and answers are posted), but members may remain relative strangers and the membership turnover rate could be high. This is in line with the liberal use of the term community.\u000aInternet-based virtual communitiesThe explosive diffusion of the Internet since the mid-1990s has also fostered the proliferation of virtual communities taking the form of social networking services and online communities. The nature of those communities is diverse, and the benefits that Rheingold envisioned are not necessarily realized, or pursued, by many. At the same time, it is rather commonplace to see anecdotes of someone in need of special help or in search of a community benefiting from the use of the Internet.\u000aVirtual communities may synthesize Web 2.0 technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970''s on timeshare systems like PLATO and later on USENET. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This emphasizes the reciprocity element of the unwritten social contract between community members. \u000aThe embedding of virtual community in the experiences of everyday life and its reflection of and influence on the communication practices and patterns of identity formation make online community a colossal research enterprise which requires continuous investigation and theorizing.Rybas, S. (2008). Community Revisited: Invoking the Subjectivity of the Online Learner. PhD Thesis. Graduate College of Bowling Green State University.\u000aHoward Rheingold''s StudyHoward Rheingold\u2019s Virtual Community could be compared with Mark Granovetter\u2019s ground-breaking "strength of weak ties" article published twenty years earlier in the American Journal of Sociology. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter\u2019s conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: \u201cMy seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world.\u201d (page 1).  Indeed, in his revised version of Virtual Community, Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read Barry Wellman''s work earlier, he would have called his book "online social networks".Rheingold\u2019s definition contains the terms \u201csocial aggregation and personal relationships\u201d (pp3). Lipnack & Stamps (1997) and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack & Stamps (1997) mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce "desocialization" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, eg. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a dystopia argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. However, more than a decade of research has not supported Calhoun''s arguments. (Wellman & Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by, for example, leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulging in their diseases.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(3,0,'{{distinguish}}Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data.  Data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information. It is commonly used in a wide range of profiling practices, such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection and scientific discovery. Data mining can be used to uncover patterns in data but is often carried out only on samples of data. The mining process will be ineffective if the samples are not a good representation of the larger body of data. Data mining cannot discover patterns that may be present in the larger body of data if those patterns are not present in the sample being "mined". Inability to find patterns may become a cause for some disputes between customers and service providers. Therefore data mining is not foolproof but may be useful if sufficiently representative data samples are collected. The discovery of a particular pattern in a particular set of data does not necessarily mean that a pattern is found elsewhere in the larger data from which that sample was drawn. An important part of the process is the verification and validation of patterns on other samples of data.The related terms data dredging, data fishing and data snooping refer to the use of data mining techniques to sample sizes that are (or may be) too small for statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered (see also data-snooping bias). Data dredging may, however, be used to develop new hypotheses, which must then be validated with sufficiently large sample sets.\u000aBackgroundHumans have been "manually" extracting patterns from data for centuries, but the increasing volume of data in modern times has called for more automated approaches. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes'' theorem (1700s) and regression analysis (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has increased data collection and storage. As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct hands-on data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automatic data processing. This has been aided by other discoveries in computer science, such as neural networks, clustering, genetic algorithms (1950s), decision trees (1960s) and support vector machines (1980s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods to data with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns.{{cite book}} It has been used for many years by businesses, scientists and governments to sift through volumes of data such as airline passenger trip records, census data and supermarket scanner data to produce market research reports. (Note, however, that reporting is not always considered to be data mining.)A primary reason for using data mining is to assist in the analysis of collections of observations of behaviour. Such data are vulnerable to collinearity because of unknown interrelations. An unavoidable fact of data mining is that the (sub-)set(s) of data being analysed may not be representative of the whole domain, and therefore may not contain examples of certain critical relationships and behaviours that exist across other parts of the domain. To address this sort of issue, the analysis may be augmented using experiment-based and other approaches, such as Choice Modelling for human-generated data. In these situations, inherent correlations can be either controlled for, or removed altogether, during the construction of the experimental design.There have been some efforts to define standards for data mining, for example the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 Java Data Mining standard (JDM 1.0). These are evolving standards; later versions of these standards are under development. Independent of these standardization efforts, freely available open-source software systems like the R Project, Weka, KNIME, RapidMiner and others have become an informal standard for defining data-mining processes. Notably, all these systems are able to import and export models in PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) which provides a standard way to represent data mining models so that these can be shared between different statistical applicationsAlex Guazzelli, Wen-Ching Lin, Tridivesh Jena. PMML in Action: Unleashing the Power of Open Standards for Data Mining and Predictive Analytics. CreateSpace, 2010. PMML is an XML-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG)The Data Mining Group (DMG). The DMG is an independent, vendor led group which develops data mining standards, such as the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML)., an independent group composed of many data mining companies. PMML version 4.0 was released in June 2009.PMML Project PageAlex Guazzelli, Michael Zeller, Wen-Ching Lin, Graham Williams. PMML: An Open Standard for Sharing Models. The R Journal, vol 1/1, May 2009.\u000aResearch and evolutionIn addition to industry driven demand for standards and interoperability, professional and academic activity have also made considerable contributions to the evolution and rigour of the methods and models; an article published in a 2008 issue of the International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making summarises the results of a literature survey which traces and analyzes this evolution.{{cite Journal}}The premier professional body in the field is the Association for Computing Machinery''s Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (SIGKDD).{{Citation needed}} Since 1989 they have hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings,Proceedings, International Conferences on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, ACM, New York. and since 1999 have published a biannual academic journal titled "SIGKDD Explorations".SIGKDD Explorations, ACM, New York.

As data mining can only uncover patterns already present in the data, the target dataset must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined in an acceptable timeframe. A common source for data is a datamart or data warehouse. Pre-process is essential to analyse the multivariate datasets before clustering or data mining.The target set is then cleaned. Cleaning removes the observations with noise and missing data.The clean data are reduced into feature vectors, one vector per observation. A feature vector is a summarised version of the raw data observation. For example, a black and white image of a face which is 100px by 100px would contain 10,000 bits of raw data. This might be turned into a feature vector by locating the eyes and mouth in the image. Doing so would reduce the data for each vector from 10,000 bits to three codes for the locations, dramatically reducing the size of the dataset to be mined, and hence reducing the processing effort. The feature(s) selected will depend on what the objective(s) is/are; obviously, selecting the "right" feature(s) is fundamental to successful data mining. The feature vectors are divided into two sets, the "training set" and the "test set". The training set is used to "train" the data mining algorithm(s), while the test set is used to verify the accuracy of any patterns found.\u000aData miningData mining commonly involves four classes of tasks:{{cite web}}\u000a\u000aClustering - is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another &#34;similar&#34;, without using known structures in the data.\u000aClassification - is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an email program might attempt to classify an email as legitimate or spam. Common algorithms include decision tree learning, nearest neighbor, naive Bayesian classification and neural networks.\u000aRegression - Attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error. \u000aAssociation rule learning - Searches for relationships between variables. For example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis.\u000a\u000aSee also structured data analysis.\u000aResults validationThe final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set, this is called overfitting. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a test set of data which the data mining algorithm was not trained on. The learnt patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample emails. Once trained, the learnt patterns would be applied to the test set of emails which it had not been trained on, the accuracy of these patterns can then be measured from how many emails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as ROC curves.If the learnt patterns do not meet the desired standards, then it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and data mining. If the learnt patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learnt patterns and turn them into knowledge.\u000aNotable uses\u000aGamesSince the early 1960s, with the availability of oracles for certain combinatorial games, also called tablebases (e.g. for 3x3-chess) with any beginning configuration, small-board dots-and-boxes, small-board-hex, and certain endgames in chess, dots-and-boxes, and hex; a new area for data mining has been opened up. This is the extraction of human-usable strategies from these oracles. Current pattern recognition approaches do not seem to fully have the required high level of abstraction in order to be applied successfully.  Instead, extensive experimentation with the tablebases, combined with an intensive study of tablebase-answers to well designed problems and with knowledge of prior art, i.e. pre-tablebase knowledge, is used to yield insightful patterns. Berlekamp in dots-and-boxes etc. and John Nunn in chess endgames are notable examples of researchers doing this work, though they were not and are not involved in tablebase generation.\u000aBusinessData mining in customer relationship management applications can contribute significantly to the bottom line.{{Citation needed}}  Rather than randomly contacting a prospect or customer through a call center or sending mail, a company can concentrate its efforts on prospects that are predicted to have a high likelihood of responding to an offer.  More sophisticated methods may be used to optimise resources across campaigns so that one may predict which channel and which offer an individual is most likely to respond to&nbsp;\u2014 across all potential offers.  Additionally, sophisticated applications could be used to automate the mailing. Once the results from data mining (potential prospect/customer and channel/offer) are determined,  this "sophisticated application" can either automatically send an e-mail or regular mail.  Finally, in cases where many people will take an action without an offer, uplift modeling can be used to determine which people will have the greatest increase in responding if given an offer. Data clustering can also be used to automatically discover the segments or groups within a customer data set.Businesses employing data mining may see a return on investment, but also they recognise that the number of predictive models can quickly become very large.  Rather than one model to predict how many customers will churn, a business could build a separate model for each region and customer type.  Then instead of sending an offer to all people that are likely to churn, it may only want to send offers to customers that will likely take an offer.  And finally, it may also want to determine which customers are going to be profitable over a window of time and only send the offers to those that are likely to be profitable.  In order to maintain this quantity of models, they need to manage model versions and move to automated data mining.Data mining can also be helpful to human-resources departments in identifying the characteristics of their most successful employees. Information obtained, such as universities attended by highly successful employees, can help HR focus recruiting efforts accordingly. Additionally, Strategic Enterprise Management applications help a company translate corporate-level goals, such as profit and margin share targets, into operational decisions, such as production plans and workforce levels.{{cite book}}Another example of data mining, often called the market basket analysis, relates to its use in retail sales. If a clothing store records the purchases of customers, a data-mining system could identify those customers who favour silk shirts over cotton ones. Although some explanations of relationships may be difficult, taking advantage of it is easier. The example deals with association rules within transaction-based data. Not all data are transaction based and logical or inexact rules may also be present within a database. In a manufacturing application, an inexact rule may state that 73% of products which have a specific defect or problem will develop a secondary problem within the next six months.Market basket analysis has also been used to identify the purchase patterns of the Alpha consumer. Alpha Consumers are people that play a key roles in connecting with the concept behind a product, then adopting that product, and finally validating it for the rest of society. Analyzing the data collected on these type of users has allowed companies to predict future buying trends and forecast supply demands.Data Mining is a highly effective tool in the catalog marketing industry.  Catalogers have a rich history of customer transactions on millions of customers dating back several years.  Data mining tools can identify patterns among customers and help identify the most likely customers to respond to upcoming mailing campaigns.Related to an integrated-circuit production line, an example of data mining is described in the paper "Mining IC Test Data to Optimize VLSI Testing."Tony Fountain, Thomas Dietterich & Bill Sudyka (2000) Mining IC Test Data to Optimize VLSI Testing, in Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining. (pp. 18-25). ACM Press. In this paper the application of data mining and decision analysis to the problem of die-level functional test is described.  Experiments mentioned in this paper demonstrate the ability of applying a system of mining historical die-test data to create a probabilistic model of patterns of die failure which are then utilised to decide in real time which die to test next and when to stop testing.  This system has been shown, based on experiments with historical test data, to have the potential to improve profits on mature IC products.\u000aScience and engineeringIn recent years, data mining has been widely used in area of science and engineering, such as bioinformatics, genetics, medicine, education and electrical power engineering.In the area of study on human genetics, the important goal is to understand the mapping relationship between the inter-individual variation in human DNA sequences and variability in disease susceptibility. In lay terms, it is to find out how the changes in an individual''s DNA sequence affect the risk of developing common diseases such as cancer. This is very important to help improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the diseases. The data mining technique that is used to perform this task is known as multifactor dimensionality reduction.{{cite book}}In the area of electrical power engineering, data mining techniques have been widely used for condition monitoring of high voltage electrical equipment. The purpose of condition monitoring is to obtain valuable information on the insulation''s health status of the equipment. Data clustering such as self-organizing map (SOM) has been applied on the vibration monitoring and analysis of transformer on-load tap-changers(OLTCS). Using vibration monitoring, it can be observed that each tap change operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms. Obviously, different tap positions will generate different signals. However, there was considerable variability amongst normal condition signals for the exact same tap position. SOM has been applied to detect abnormal conditions and to estimate the nature of the abnormalities.{{cite Journal}}Data mining techniques have also been applied for dissolved gas analysis (DGA) on power transformers. DGA, as a diagnostics for power transformer, has been available for many years. Data mining techniques such as SOM has been applied to analyse data and to determine trends which are not obvious to the standard DGA ratio techniques such as Duval Triangle.A fourth area of application for data mining in science/engineering is within educational research, where data mining has been used to study the factors leading students to choose to engage in behaviors which reduce their learning{{cite Journal}} and to understand the factors influencing university student retention.{{cite Journal}} A similar example of the social application of data mining is its use in expertise finding systems, whereby descriptors of human expertise are extracted, normalised and classified so as to facilitate the finding of experts, particularly in scientific and technical fields.  In this way, data mining can facilitate Institutional memory.Other examples of applying data mining technique applications are biomedical data facilitated by domain ontologies,{{cite book}} mining clinical trial data,ibid. pp. 31\u201348. traffic analysis using SOM,{{cite Journal}} et cetera.In adverse drug reaction surveillance, the Uppsala Monitoring Centre has, since 1998, used data mining methods to routinely screen for reporting patterns indicative of emerging drug safety issues in the WHO global database of 4.6 million suspected adverse drug reaction incidents.Bate A, Lindquist M, Edwards IR, Olsson S, Orre R, Lansner A, De Freitas RM.

Recently, similar methodology has been developed to mine large collections of electronic health records for temporal patterns associating drug prescriptions to medical diagnoses.Nor\u00e9n GN, Bate A, Hopstadius J, Star K, Edwards IR. Temporal Pattern Discovery for Trends and Transient Effects: Its Application to Patient Records. Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining SIGKDD 2008, pages 963-971. Las Vegas NV, 2008.\u000aSpatial data miningSpatial data mining is the application of data mining techniques to spatial data. Spatial data mining follows along the same functions in data mining, with the end objective to find patterns in geography. So far, data mining and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have existed as two separate technologies, each with its own methods, traditions and approaches to visualization and data analysis. Particularly, most contemporary GIS have only very basic spatial analysis functionality.  The immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in IT, digital mapping, remote sensing, and the global diffusion of GIS emphasises the importance of developing data driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling.Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-based decision-making. Recently, the task of integrating these two technologies has become critical, especially as various public and private sector organisations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realise the huge potential of the information hidden there. Among those organisations are: \u000a\u000aoffices requiring analysis or dissemination of geo-referenced statistical data \u000apublic health services searching for explanations of disease clusters \u000aenvironmental agencies assessing the impact of changing land-use patterns on climate change \u000ageo-marketing companies doing customer segmentation based on spatial location. \u000a\u000a\u000aChallengesGeospatial data repositories tend to be very large.  Moreover, existing GIS datasets are often splintered into feature and attribute components, that are conventionally archived in hybrid data management systems. Algorithmic requirements differ substantially for relational (attribute) data management and for topological (feature) data management Healey, R., 1991, Database Management Systems. In Maguire, D., Goodchild, M.F., and Rhind, D., (eds.), Geographic Information Systems: Principles and Applications (London: Longman)..  Related to this is the range and diversity of geographic data formats, that also presents unique challenges. The digital geographic data revolution is creating new types of data formats beyond the traditional "vector" and "raster" formats. Geographic data repositories increasingly include ill-structured data such as imagery and geo-referenced multi-media C\u00e2mara, A. S. and Raper, J., (eds.), 1999, Spatial Multimedia and Virtual Reality, (London: Taylor and Francis).. There are several critical research challenges in geographic knowledge discovery and data mining. Miller and Han Miller, H. and Han, J., (eds.), 2001, Geographic Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, (London: Taylor & Francis). offer the following list of emerging research topics in the field:\u000a\u000aDeveloping and supporting geographic data warehouses - Spatial properties are often reduced to simple aspatial attributes in mainstream data warehouses.  Creating an integrated GDW requires solving issues in spatial and temporal data interoperability, including differences in semantics, referencing systems, geometry, accuracy and position.\u000aBetter spatio-temporal representations in geographic knowledge discovery - Current geographic knowledge discovery (GKD) techniques generally use very simple representations of geographic objects and spatial relationships.  Geographic data mining techniques should recognise more complex geographic objects (lines and polygons) and relationships (non-Euclidean distances, direction, connectivity and interaction through attributed geographic space such as terrain). Time needs to be more fully integrated into these geographic representations and relationships.\u000aGeographic knowledge discovery using diverse data types - GKD techniques should be developed that can handle diverse data types beyond the traditional raster and vector models, including imagery and geo-referenced multimedia, as well as dynamic data types (video streams, animation).\u000a\u000a\u000aSurveillancePrevious data mining to stop terrorist programs under the U.S. government include the Total Information Awareness (TIA) program, Secure Flight (formerly known as Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II)), Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, Semantic Enhancement (ADVISEGovernment Accountability Office, Data Mining: Early Attention to Privacy in Developing a Key DHS Program Could Reduce Risks, GAO-07-293, Washington, D.C.: February 2007.), and the  Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX).Secure Flight Program report, MSNBC. These programs have been discontinued due to controversy over whether they violate the US Constitution''s 4th amendment, although many programs that were formed under them continue to be funded by different organisations, or under different names.{{cite web}}Two plausible data mining techniques in the context of combating terrorism include "pattern mining" and "subject-based data mining".\u000aPattern mining"Pattern mining" is a data mining technique that involves finding existing patterns in data. In this context patterns often means association rules. The original motivation for searching association rules came from the desire to analyze supermarket transaction data, that is, to examine customer behaviour in terms of the purchased products. For example, an association rule "beer \u21d2 crisps (80%)" states that four out of five customers that bought beer also bought crisps. In the context of pattern mining as a tool to identify terrorist activity, the National Research Council provides the following definition: "Pattern-based data mining looks for patterns (including anomalous data patterns) that might be associated with terrorist activity \u2014 these patterns might be regarded as small signals in a large ocean of noise."R. Agrawal et al., Fast discovery of association rules, in Advances in knowledge discovery and data mining pp. 307-328, MIT Press, 1996.National Research Council, Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists: A Framework for Program Assessment, Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2008.{{cite book}} Pattern Mining includes new areas such a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) where patterns seen both in the temporal and non temporal domains are imported to classical knowledge discovery search techniques.\u000aSubject-based data mining"Subject-based data mining" is a data mining technique involving the search for associations between individuals in data.  In the context of combatting terrorism, the National Research Council provides the following definition: "Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other datum that is considered, based on other information, to be of high interest, and the goal is to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements, etc., are related to that initiating datum."\u000aPrivacy concerns and ethicsSome people believe that data mining itself is ethically neutral.{{cite journal}} However, the ways in which data mining can be used can raise questions regarding privacy, legality, and ethics.{{cite journal}} In particular, data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes, such as in the Total Information Awareness Program or in ADVISE, has raised privacy concerns.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}} Data mining requires data preparation which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation is when the data are accrued, possibly from various sources, and put together so that they can be analyzed.Think Before You Dig: Privacy Implications of Data Mining & Aggregation, NASCIO Research Brief, September 2004. This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before and for the purposes of the analysis. The threat to an individual''s privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly-compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when originally the data were anonymous.It is recommended that an individual is made aware of the following before data are collected: \u000a\u000athe purpose of the data collection and any data mining projects, \u000ahow the data will be used, \u000awho will be able to mine the data and use them, \u000athe security surrounding access to the data, and in addition, \u000ahow collected data can be updated.\u000a\u000aIn the United States, privacy concerns have been somewhat addressed by their congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to be given "informed consent" regarding any information that they provide and its intended future uses by the facility receiving that information. According to an article in Biotech Business Week, \u201cIn practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena, says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule''s goal of protection through informed consent is undermined by the complexity of consent forms that are required of patients and participants, which approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals.\u201d Biotech Business Week Editors. (June 30, 2008). BIOMEDICINE; HIPAA Privacy Rule Impedes Biomedical Research. Biotech Business Week.  Retrieved 17 Nov 2009 from LexisNexis Academic. This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation practices.One may additionally modify the data so that they are anonymous, so that individuals may not be readily identified. However, even de-identified data sets can contain enough information to identify individuals, as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL.AOL search data identified individuals, SecurityFocus, August 2006.\u000aMarketplace surveysSeveral researchers and organizations have conducted reviews of data mining tools and surveys of data miners.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(4,0,'{{for}}\u000a{{Unreferenced}}Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data, such as from sensor data or databases. A major focus of machine learning research is to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data; the difficulty lies in the fact that the set of all possible behaviors given all possible inputs is too complex to describe generally in programming languages, so that in effect programs must automatically describe programs. Artificial intelligence is a closely related field, as also probability theory and statistics, data mining, pattern recognition, adaptive control, and theoretical computer science.\u000aDefinitionA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.Tom M. Mitchell (1997) Machine Learning p.2\u000a\u000aHuman interactionSome machine learning systems attempt to eliminate the need for human intuition in data analysis, while others adopt a collaborative approach between human and machine. Human intuition cannot, however, be entirely eliminated, since the system''s designer must specify how the data is to be represented and what mechanisms will be used to search for a characterization of the data.\u000aAlgorithm typesMachine learning algorithms are organized into a taxonomy, based on the desired outcome of the algorithm.\u000a\u000aSupervised learning generates a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. For example, in a classification problem, the learner approximates a function mapping a vector into classes by looking at input-output examples of the function.\u000aUnsupervised learning models a set of inputs, like clustering.\u000aSemi-supervised learning combines both labeled and unlabeled examples to generate an appropriate function or classifier.\u000aReinforcement learning learns how to act given an observation of the world.  Every action has some impact in the environment, and the environment provides feedback in the form of rewards that guides the learning algorithm.\u000aTransduction tries to predict new outputs based on training inputs, training outputs, and test inputs.\u000aLearning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience.\u000a\u000a\u000aTheory{{Main}}\u000aThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.  Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield absolute guaranties of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common.In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.There are many similarities between Machine Learning theory and Statistics, although they use different terms.\u000aApproaches{{Main}}\u000aDecision tree learning{{Main}}\u000aDecision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item''s target value.\u000aAssociation rule learning{{Main}}\u000aAssociation rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.  \u000aArtificial neural networks{{Main}}\u000aAn artificial neural network (ANN), usually called "neural network" (NN), is a mathematical model or computational model that tries to simulate the structure and/or functional aspects of biological neural networks. It consists of an interconnected group of artificial neurons and processes information using a connectionist approach to computation. Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data. \u000aGenetic programming{{Main}}\u000aGenetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user-defined task. It is a specialization of genetic algorithms (GA) where each individual is a computer program. It is a machine learning technique used to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program''s ability to perform a given computational task.\u000aInductive logic programming{{Main}}\u000aInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning uses logic programming as a uniform representation for examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesised logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples.\u000aSupport vector machines{{Main}}\u000aSupport vector machines (SVMs) are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.\u000aClustering{{Main}}\u000aCluster analysis or clustering is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are similar in some sense. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning,  and a common technique for statistical data analysis.\u000aBayesian networks{{Main}}\u000aA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.  Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.\u000aReinforcement learning{{Main}}\u000aReinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long-term reward.  Reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states.  Reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input/output pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected.\u000aApplicationsApplications for machine learning include machine perception, computer vision, natural language processing, syntactic pattern recognition, search engines, medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, brain-machine interfaces and cheminformatics, detecting credit card fraud, stock market analysis, classifying DNA sequences, speech and handwriting recognition, object recognition in computer vision, game playing, software engineering, adaptive websites, robot locomotion, and structural health monitoring.\u000aSoftwareRapidMiner and Weka are software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms.\u000aJournals and conferences\u000a\u000aMachine Learning (journal)\u000aJournal of Machine Learning Research\u000aInternational Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) (conference)\u000aNeural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (conference)\u000aList of upcoming Machine Learning Conferences (conference)\u000a\u000a\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aComputational intelligence\u000aData mining\u000aExplanation-based learning\u000aImportant publications in machine learning\u000a \u000a\u000aMulti-label classification\u000aPattern recognition\u000aPredictive analytics\u000a \u000a\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading{{Ref begin}}\u000a\u000aSergios Theodoridis, Konstantinos Koutroumbas (2009) &#34;Pattern Recognition&#34; , 4th Edition, Academic Press, ISBN 978-1-59749-272-0.\u000aEthem Alpayd\u0131n (2004) Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning), MIT Press, ISBN 0262012111\u000aChristopher M.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(5,0,'\u000aThe term "Web 2.0" is commonly associated with web applications that facilitate interactive information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design,{{cite web}} and collaboration on the World Wide Web. A Web 2.0 site allows its users to interact with each other as contributors to the website''s content, in contrast to websites where users are limited to the passive viewing of information that is provided to them. Examples of Web 2.0 include web-based communities, hosted services, web applications, social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs, mashups, and folksonomies. The term is closely associated with Tim O''Reilly because of the O''Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference in 2004.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}\u000aAlthough the term suggests a new version of the World Wide Web, it does not refer to an update to any technical specifications, but rather to cumulative changes in the ways software developers and end-users use the Web. Whether Web 2.0 is qualitatively different from prior web technologies has been challenged by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, who called the term a "piece of jargon" \u2014 precisely because he specifically intended the Web to embody these values in the first place.\u000aHistoryThe term "Web 2.0" was coined in 1999 by Darcy DiNucci. In her article, "Fragmented Future," DiNucci writes:{{cite journal}}\u000a{{quote}}Her use of the term deals mainly with Web design and aesthetics; she argues that the Web is "fragmenting" due to the widespread use of portable Web-ready devices. Her article is aimed at designers, reminding them to code for an ever-increasing variety of hardware. As such, her use of the term hints at &ndash; but does not directly relate to &ndash; the current uses of the term.The term did not resurface until 2003.Idehen, Kingsley. 2003. RSS: INJAN (It''s not just about news). Blog. Blog Data Space. August 21 OpenLinksW.comIdehen, Kingsley. 2003. Jeff Bezos Comments about Web Services. Blog. Blog Data Space. September 25. OpenLinksW.comKnorr, Eric. 2003. The year of Web services. CIO, December 15. These authors focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, "the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform".ibidIn 2004, the term began its rise in popularity when O''Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, John Battelle and Tim O''Reilly outlined their definition of the "Web as Platform", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that "customers are building your business for you".O''Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In . San Francisco, CA, October 5. They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be "harnessed" to create value. O''Reilly et al. contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called "Web 1.0". They associated Web 1.0 with the business models of Netscape and the Encyclopedia Britannica Online. For example,\u000aNetscape framed "the web as platform" in terms of the old software paradigm: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the "horseless carriage" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a "webtop" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.\u000aIn short, Netscape focused on creating software, updating it on occasion, and distributing it to the end users. O''Reilly contrasted this with Google, a company which did not at the time focus on producing software, such as a browser, but instead focused on providing a service based on data. The data being the links Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web search based on reputation through its "page rank" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called "the perpetual beta". A similar difference can be seen between the Encyclopedia Britannica Online and Wikipedia: while the Britannica relies upon experts to create articles and releases them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in anonymous users to constantly and quickly build content. Wikipedia is not based on expertise but rather an adaptation of the open source software adage "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", and it produces and updates articles constantly.O''Reilly''s Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, large companies, and technology reporters. In terms of the lay public, the term Web 2.0 was largely championed by bloggers and by technology journalists, culminating in the 2006 TIME magazine Person of The Year &ndash; "You".Grossman, Lev. 2006. Person of the Year: You. December 25. Time.com That is, TIME selected the masses of users who were participating in content creation on social networks, blogs, wikis, and media sharing sites. \u000aThe cover story author Lev Grossman explains:\u000aIt''s a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It''s about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel people''s network YouTube and the online metropolis MySpace. It''s about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.\u000aSince that time, Web 2.0 has found a place in the lexicon; in 2009 Global Language Monitor declared it to be the one-millionth English word."''Millionth English Word'' declared". NEWS.BBC.co.uk\u000aCharacteristics\u000aWeb 2.0 websites allow users to do more than just retrieve information. They can build on the interactive facilities of "Web 1.0" to provide "Network as platform" computing, allowing users to run software-applications entirely through a browser. Users can own the data on a Web 2.0 site and exercise control over that data.{{cite web}} These sites may have an "Architecture of participation" that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.The concept of Web-as-participation-platform captures many of these characteristics. Bart Decrem, a founder and former CEO of Flock, calls Web 2.0 the "participatory Web"{{cite web}} and regards the Web-as-information-source as Web 1.0.\u0009The impossibility of excluding group-members who don\u2019t contribute to the provision of goods from sharing profits gives rise to the possibility that rational members will prefer to withhold their contribution of effort and free-ride on the contribution of others.Gerald Marwell and Ruth E. Ames: "Experiments on the Provision of Public Goods. I. Resources, Interest, Group Size, and the Free-Rider Problem". The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 84, No. 6 (May, 1979), pp. 1335&ndash;1360 This requires what is sometimes called Radical Trust by the management of the website. \u000aAccording to Best,Best, D., 2006. Web 2.0 Next Big Thing or Next Big Internet Bubble? Lecture Web Information Systems. Techni sche Universiteit Eindhoven. the characteristics of Web 2.0 are: rich user experience, user participation, dynamic content, metadata, web standards and scalability. Further characteristics, such as openness, freedom{{cite web}} and collective intelligenceO\u2019Reilly, T., 2005. What is Web 2.0. Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software, 30, p.2005 by way of user participation, can also be viewed as essential attributes of Web 2.0.\u000aTechnology overviewWeb 2.0 draws together the capabilities of client- and server-side software, content syndication and the use of network protocols. Standards-oriented web browsers may use plug-ins and software extensions to handle the content and the user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with information storage, creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment now known as "Web 1.0".Web 2.0 websites typically include some of the following features and techniques. Andrew McAfee used the acronym SLATES to refer to them:McAfee, A. (2006). Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration. MIT Sloan Management review. Vol. 47, No. 3, p. 21&ndash;28.\u000a\u000aSearch\u000aFinding information through keyword search.\u000aLinks\u000aConnects information together into a meaningful information ecosystem using the model of the Web, and provides low-barrier social tools. \u000aAuthoring\u000aThe ability to create and update content leads to the collaborative work of many rather than just a few web authors. In wikis, users may extend, undo and redo each other&#39;s work. In blogs, posts and the comments of individuals build up over time.\u000aTags\u000aCategorization of content by users adding &#34;tags&#34; - short, usually one-word descriptions - to facilitate searching, without dependence on pre-made categories. Collections of tags created by many users within a single system may be referred to as &#34;folksonomies&#34; (i.e., folk taxonomies).\u000aExtensions\u000aSoftware that makes the Web an application platform as well as a document server.\u000aSignals\u000aThe use of syndication technology such as RSS to notify users of content changes.\u000a\u000aWhile SLATES forms the basic framework of Enterprise 2.0, it does not contradict all of the higher level Web 2.0 design patterns and business models.  And in this way, the new Web 2.0 report from O''Reilly is quite effective and diligent in interweaving the story of Web 2.0 with the specific aspects of Enterprise 2.0.  It includes discussions of self-service IT, the long tail of enterprise IT demand, and many other consequences of the Web 2.0 era in the enterprise.  The report also makes many sensible recommendations around starting small with pilot projects and measuring results, among a fairly long list. \u000aBlogs.ZDnet.com\u000aHow it worksThe client-side/web browser technologies  typically used in Web 2.0 development are Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax), Adobe Flash and the Adobe Flex framework, and JavaScript/Ajax frameworks such as Yahoo! UI Library, Dojo Toolkit, MooTools, and jQuery.  Ajax programming uses JavaScript to upload and download new data from the web server without undergoing a full page reload.To permit the user to continue to interact with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page (asynchronously).  Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload.  This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client.   The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, Google Docs uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.Adobe Flex is another technology often used in Web 2.0 applications. Compared to JavaScript libraries like jQuery, Flex makes it easier for programmers to populate large data grids, charts, and other heavy user interactions.Maraksquires.com Applications programmed in Flex, are compiled and displayed as Flash within the browser. As a widely available plugin independent of  W3C (World Wide Web Consortium, the governing body of web standards and protocols), standards, Flash is capable of doing many things which are not currently  possible in HTML, the language used to construct web pages. Of Flash''s many capabilities, the most commonly used in Web 2.0 is its ability to play audio and video files. This has allowed for the creation of Web 2.0 sites where video media is seamlessly integrated with standard HTML.In addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks do not use technology any different from JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. What frameworks do is smooth over inconsistencies between web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated ''widgets'' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel.On the server side, Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as PHP, Ruby, ColdFusion, Perl, Python, JSP and ASP are used by developers to dynamically output data using information from files and databases. What has begun to change in Web 2.0 is the way this data is formatted. In the early days of the Internet, there was little need for different websites to communicate with each other and share data. In the new "participatory web", however, sharing data between sites has become an essential capability. To share its data with other sites, a web site must be able to generate output in machine-readable formats such as XML, RSS, and JSON. When a site''s data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to integrate a portion of that site''s functionality into itself, linking the two together. When this design pattern is implemented, it ultimately leads to data that is both easier to find and more thoroughly categorized, a hallmark of the philosophy behind the Web 2.0 movement.\u000aUsageThe popularity of the term Web 2.0, along with the increasing use of blogs, wikis, and social networking technologies, has led many in academia and business to coin a flurry of 2.0s,Schick, S., 2005. I second that emotion. IT Business.ca (Canada). including Library 2.0,Miller, P., 2008. Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation. Available at: Google.com Social Work 2.0,{{cite book}} Enterprise 2.0, PR 2.0,Breakenridge, D., 2008. PR 2.0: New Media, New Tools, New Audiences 1st ed., FT Press. Classroom 2.0, Publishing 2.0, Medicine 2.0, Telco 2.0, Travel 2.0, Government 2.0,{{cite book}} and even Porn 2.0.{{cite book}} Many of these 2.0s refer to Web 2.0 technologies as the source of the new version in their respective disciplines and areas. For example, in the Talis white paper "Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation", Paul Miller arguesBlogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web.Talis believes that Library 2.0 means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloguing efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.Miller 10&ndash;11\u000aHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a "Library 2.0". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods.\u000aWeb 3.0Not much time passed before "Web 3.0" was coined. Definitions of Web 3.0 vary greatly. Amit Agarwal states that Web 3.0 is, among other things, about the Semantic Web and personalization.Agarwal, Amit. "Web 3.0 concepts explained in plain English". Labnol.org Andrew Keen, author of The Cult of the Amateur, considers the Semantic Web an "unrealisable abstraction" and sees Web 3.0 as the return of experts and authorities to the Web. For example, he points to Bertelsman''s deal with the German Wikipedia to produce an edited print version of that encyclopedia. CNN Money''s Jessi Hempel expects Web 3.0 to emerge from new and innovative Web 2.0 services with a profitable business model.Hempel, Jessi. "Web 2.0 is so over. Welcome to Web 3.0." CNN Money. CNN.com Conrad Wolfram has argued that Web 3.0 is where "the computer is generating new information", rather than humans.Conrad Wolfram on Communicating with apps in web 3.0 IT PRO, 17 Mar 2010 Others still such as Manoj Sharma, an organization strategist, in the keynote "A Brave New World Of Web 3.0" proposes that Web 3.0 will be a "Totally Integrated World" - cradle-to-grave experience of being always plugged onto the net.Keen, Andrew. "Web 1.0 + Web 2.0 = Web 3.0." TypePad.comRajnish Sharma (Systems Officer, UPTEC Computer Consultancy, Lucknow) believes that, "The next generation of the Web is Web 3.0, will make tasks like your search faster and easier. Instead of multiple searches, you might type a complex sentence or two in your Web 3.0 browser, and the Web will do the rest. The browser will analyze your response, search the Internet for all possible answers, and then organize the results for you.\u000aThe Web 3.0 browser will act like a personal assistant. As you search the Web, the browser learns what you are interested in. The more you use the Web, the more your browser learns about you and the less specific you''ll need to be with your questions. Eventually you might be able to ask your browser open questions like ''where should I go for lunch?'' Your browser would consult its records of what you like and dislike, take into account your current location and then suggest a list of restaurants".Futurist John Smart, lead author of the Metaverse RoadmapSmart, John. 2006. "Metaverse Roadmap: Pathways to the 3D Web." http://www.metaverseroadmap.org/MetaverseRoadmapOverview.pdf echoes Sharma''s perspective, defining Web 3.0 as the first-generation Metaverse (convergence of the virtual and physical world), a web development layer that includes TV-quality open video, 3D simulations, augmented reality, human-constructed semantic standards, and pervasive broadband, wireless, and sensors. Web 3.0''s early geosocial (Foursquare, etc.) and augmented reality (Layar, etc.) webs are an extension of Web 2.0''s participatory technologies and social networks (Facebook, etc.) into 3D space. Of all its metaverse-like developments, Smart suggests Web 3.0''s most defining characteristic will be the mass diffusion of NTSC-or-better quality open video to TVs, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, a time when "the internet swallows the television."Smart, John. 2010. "The Television Will Be Revolutionized: The iPad, Internet TV, and Web 3.0."http://www.accelerating.org/articles/televisionwillberevolutionized.html Smart considers Web 4.0 to be the Semantic Web and in particular, the rise of statistical, machine-constructed semantic tags and algorithms, driven by broad collective use of conversational interfaces, perhaps circa 2020.Smart, John. 2003. "The Conversational Interface." http://www.accelerationwatch.com/lui.html David Siegel''s perspective in Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web, 2009, is consonant with this, proposing that the growth of human-constructed semantic standards and data will be a slow, industry-specific incremental process for years to come, perhaps unlikely to tip into broad social utility until after 2020.\u000aWeb-based applications and desktopsAjax has prompted the development of websites that mimic desktop applications, such as word processing, the spreadsheet, and slide-show presentation. In 2006 Google, Inc. acquired one of the best-known sites of this broad class, Writely.{{cite web}} WYSIWYG wiki and blogging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications.Several browser-based "operating systems" have emerged, including EyeOS{{cite web}} and YouOS.{{cite web}} Although coined as such, many of these services function less like a traditional operating system and more as an application platform. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating-systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these operating systems do not directly control the hardware on the client''s computer.Numerous web-based application services appeared during the dot-com bubble of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers. In 2005, WebEx acquired one of the better-known of these, Intranets.com, for $45 million.{{cite web}}\u000aInternet applications{{Main}}\u000aXML and RSS\u000aMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site''s data in another context (such as another website, a browser plugin, or a separate desktop application). Protocols which permit syndication include RSS (Really Simple Syndication&nbsp;\u2014 also known as "web syndication"), RDF (as in RSS 1.1), and Atom, all of them XML-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as web feeds.Specialized protocols such as FOAF and XFN (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites or permit end-users to interact without centralized websites. Other protocols, like XMPP can be used to provide messaging APIs. These can be used for services over the messenger.\u000aWeb APIsWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as REST and SOAP. Servers often expose proprietary APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or JSON payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and hypermedia as the engine of application state, should be self describing once an entry URI is known. Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP API and there are a range of web service specifications. EMML, or Enterprise Mashup Markup Language by the Open Mashup Alliance, is an XML markup language for creating enterprise mashups.\u000aCriticismCritics of the term claim that "Web 2.0" does not represent a new version of the World Wide Web at all, but merely continues to use so-called "Web 1.0" technologies and concepts. First, techniques such as AJAX do not replace underlying protocols like HTTP, but add an additional layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 had already been featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term "Web 2.0" emerged. Amazon.com, for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.{{cite web}} Previous developments also came from research in computer-supported collaborative learning and computer-supported cooperative work and from established products like Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino, all phenomena which precede Web 2.0.But perhaps the most common criticism is that the term is unclear or simply a buzzword.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(6,0,'{{Redirect}}\u000a{{Other uses}}{{Politics}}\u000aPolitics is a process by which groups of people make collective decisions. The term is generally applied to behavior within civil governments, but politics has been observed in other group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. It consists of "social relations involving authority or power"Definition of politics from die.net and refers to the regulation of a political unit,Politics (definition)@Everything2.com and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply policy.Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"\u000aEtymologyThe word "politics" comes from the Greek word "\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac" (politika), modeled on Aristotle''s "affairs of state", the name of his book on governing and governments, which was rendered in English mid-15 century as Latinized "Polettiques".politics, Online Etymology Dictionary Thus it became "politics" in Middle English c. 1520s (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary). The singular "politic" first coined in English 1430 and comes from Middle French "politique", in turn from Latin "politicus",politicus, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus Digital Library which is the romanization of the Greek "\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2" (politikos), meaning amongst others "of, for, or relating to citizens", "civil", "civic", "belonging to the state", \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, \u000aHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library in turn from "\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2" (polites), "citizen"\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library and that from "\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2" (polis), "city".\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library\u000aHistoryThe origin and development of government institutions is the most visible subject for the study of Politics and its history.\u000aPrimitive societiesRegardless of how civilized the world is, there are still large numbers of people living in the most primitive conditions. The most important of these because they are the most scientifically studied are the "aborigines" of Australia. The scientific study of the aboriginal Australian forms the basis of what is best known of primitive societies in general.The Totem group was the real social unit of the aboriginal Australian. The Totem is not an Australian word but it is generally accepted to designate the name of an institution which is found everywhere among primitive people. The Totem group is primarily a group of people distinguished by the sign of a natural object, such as an animal or tree, who may not intermarry with one another \u2014 this is the first rule of primitive social organization; its origin is lost in antiquity ("Alcheringa") but its object is certainly to prevent the intermarriage of close relatives. Marriage takes place between men and women of different Totems; the husband belongs to all the women of his wife''s totem and the wife belongs to all the men of the husband''s totem at the same time that a communal marriage is established between the men and women of the two different Totems - the men and women being of the same generation. This presents a most valuable objective lesson in social history. There are no unmarried couples; marriage for them is part of the natural order into which they are born.The ceremonies were kept secret and are directed by a "Birraark" or sorcerer, usually an old man. The candidates are instructed in the history of their Totem and on the power of the Birraark. They were initiated into the mystery of the Totem, usually accompanied by an ordeal such as circumcision and then they were tattooed with a seal of identity that marks them for a given Totem and a given generation in that Totem. In this way is constructed the simple system of relationship of the aboriginal Australian before British colonization. The mother took a predominant role, for descent was almost always reckoned through females. Parent, child, brother and sister were the only recognized relationships. Rudimentary as this system may appear to be, it is widely spread among the Malay Archipelago and prevails widely among primitive peoples everywhere.The Totem served the purpose of forbidding intermarriage between close relatives and will deal destruction if this rule is not strictly enforced. These are the rudiments of two of the most important factors in human progress: Religion and Law. The rudimentary notion of Law is very specific about what is prohibited or Taboo. Primitive people do not recognize any duties towards strangers unless there is an abundant food supply in a given area. It is a sure sign of progress if the same area is able to maintain an ever larger number of people. Lewis H. Morgan author of Ancient Society considers the American Indians to be the link between the primitive and patriarchal state of society.{{cite book}}According to legend and the Codex Chimalpopoca, Quetzalcoatl being intoxicated with pulque had incest with his sister Quetzalpetlatl. Upon realizing the act, he declared: "... I''ve sinned. I''m not fit to rule." He burned his palace, buried his treasures and left forever the beloved city of Tollan, cradle of Toltec civilization.{{cite book}}\u000aPatriarchal societiesAll patriarchal societies are known by certain characteristic features:\u000a\u000aMale kinship is prevalent. Men are counted as kin because they are descended from the same male ancestor.\u000aMarriage is permanent. It is not until one woman is married to one man that certainty of fatherhood appears in society but it is not a general rule of patriarchal society for polygamy does exist in the earlier stages of social development.\u000aPaternal authority is the ruling principle of the social order. In ancient Rome, the patria potestas extended to all descendants of one living male ancestor; it comprised control and punishment not to mention questions of life and death.\u000a\u000aThese features of the development of the patriarchal state of society are as common among the Jews as among the Arabs, among the Aryans as among the Dravidians and even among the Germanic and Celtic peoples.The patriarchal state of society consists of two stages, tribe and clan. The tribe is a large group of hundreds of members who descend from one common male ancestor, sometimes from a fictitious character satisfying the etiquette that descent from the male is the only basis of society. The clan, on the other hand, is a smaller group reaching back into the past for only four generations or so to a common well-known male ancestor. The clan always breaks down into smaller units when its limit is reached. According to the Scottish historian W. F. Skene in volumen 3 of Celtic Scotland, the tribe or larger unit is the oldest. When the tribe breaks down, clans are formed. When the clan system breaks down, it leaves the households or families as independent units. Finally, with the withering away of patriarchal society, the family is dissolved and the individual comes into existence.{{cite book}}\u000aThe state\u000aThe origin of the State is to be found in the development of the art of warfare. Historically speaking, there is not the slightest difficulty in proving that all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare. As a result the new states are forced to organize on military principles. The life of the new community is military allegiance. The military by nature is competitive.Of the institutions by which the state is ruled, that of kingship stands foremost until the French Revolution put an end to the "divine right of kings". Nevertheless, kingship is perhaps the most successful institution of politics. However, the first kings were not institutions but individuals. The earliest kings were successful militarily. They were men not only of great military genius but also great administrators. Kingship becomes an institution through heredity. However, constitutional monarchies are not successful at all. Elective monarchy is one of the chimeras of political utopia. Chosen by an electorate, the best they become is obedient puppets like the newly elected president of a republic, obedient to whoever would pull the strings behind the scenes.The king rules his kingdom with the aid of his Council; without it he could not hold his territories. The Council is the king''s master mind. The Council is the germ of constitutional government. Long before the council became a bulwark of democracy, it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship by:\u000a\u000aPreserving the institution of kingship through heredity.\u000aPreserving the traditions of the social order.\u000aBeing able to withstand criticism as an impersonal authority.\u000aBeing able to manage a greater deal of knowledge and action than a single individual such as the king.\u000a\u000aThe greatest of the king''s subordinates, the earls in England and Scotland, the dukes and counts in the Continent, always sat as a right on the Council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts tribute. One of the functions of the Council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of military service and the establishment of lordships by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.{{cite book}}\u000aThe state and propertyNo political institution is of greater importance than the institution of property. Property is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy the benefits of an object be it material or intellectual. A right is a power enforced by public trust. Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust. Nevertheless, a right is really the creation of public trust, past, present or future. The growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution. The more man becomes knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual, the more it is appropriated. The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry. In the presence of the State, man can hold landed property. The State began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came inheritance. With landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods, profit, so that in modern times, the "lord of the land" of long ago becomes the landlord. If it is wrongly assumed that the value of land is always the same, then there is of course no evolution of property whatever. However, the price of land goes up with every increase in population benefitting the landlord. The landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services. In industry, the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry, the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit. Towards the latter part of the Middle Ages in Europe, both the State - the State would use the instrument of confiscation for the first time to satisfy a debt - and the Church - the Church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land - were allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they were successful to the extent that today, the village has become the ideal of the individualist, a place in which every man "does what he wills with his own." The State has been the most important factor in the evolution of the institution of property be it public or private.{{cite book}}\u000aThe state and the justice systemAs a military institution, the State is concerned with the allegiance of its subjects is a risk to its national security. Thus arises the law of treason. Criminal acts in general, breaking the peace and treason make up the whole of criminal law enforced by the State as distinguished from the law enforced by private individuals. State justice has taken the place of clan, feudal, merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength, skill and simplicity. One very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that, until comparatively late in history, the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings. The most innovative proceeding introduced by the royal courts was trial by jury becoming not only popular but also the bulwark of liberty. By the time of the Protestant Reformation, with the separation of Church and State, in the most progressive countries, the State succeeded in dealing with the business of administering justice.{{cite book}}\u000aThe stateThe making of laws was unknown to primitive societies.That most persistent of all patriarchal societies, the Jewish, retains to a certain extent its tribal law in the Gentile cities of the West. This tribal law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the patriarchal stage of society, it was custom or observance sanctioned by the approval and practice of ancestors.The intolerable state of affairs in the 10th century where every little town had its own laws and nations like France, Germany, Spain and other countries had no national law till the end of the 18th century, came to an end thanks to three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation:\u000a\u000aRecords. From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called folk-laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal is becoming the State. They are due almost universally to one cause: the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects. These are not legislation in the sense of law-making but statements or declarations of custom. They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people. Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written. It is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says. Nevertheless, the written text can change by addition with every new edition.\u000aLaw Courts. By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences, English common law was modelled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom. The reason why in the rest of Europe, there was no common law till centuries later is because the State in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England did. One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to questions of fact. At first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact; and being a purely local body, they followed local custom. A famous division came to pass: the province of the judge and the province of the jury.\u000aFictions. Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law-making but like Fictions, they were slow and imperfect. Though slowly, Fictions work because it is a well known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open.\u000a\u000aFinally there is the enactment of laws or legislation. When progress and development is rapid, the faster method of political representation is adopted. This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same. From the town assembly, a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang Parliament all over Europe around the end of the 12th century but not entirely representative or homogenous for the nobility and the clergy. The clergy had amassed a fortune in land, about one-fifth of all Christendom but at the time, in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Church was following a policy of isolation; they adopted the rule of celibacy and cut themselves from domestic life; they refused to plead in a secular court; they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds that they had already paid it to the Pope. Since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money, the Church could not be left out and so they came to Parliament. The Church did not like it but in most cases they had to come.The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm: nobles, clergy, peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant taxation. Only by the strongest pressure of the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the Crown was weak, Parliament ceased to exist. The notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts. Originally, the representative side of Parliament was solely concerned with money; representation in Parliament was a liability rather than a privilege. It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another. People who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to petition. Pretty soon, sessions in Parliament would turn into bargaining tables, the king granting petitions in exchange for money. However, there were two kinds of petitions, one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or legislation originated. The king as head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place. Even to the present day, this has always been the basis of all successful legislation: public custom is adopted and enforced by the State.In the early days of political representation, the majority did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested elections but by the beginning of the 15th century, a seat in Parliament was something to be cherished. Historically speaking, the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times: the party system. The party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate; its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics; it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent policy in government.These three institutions: political representation, majority rule and the party system are the basic components of modern political machinery; they are applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their adaptability ends in themselves rather than a machinery to achieve some purpose.{{cite book}}\u000aThe state and the executive systemThe administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government. In the enactment and enforcement of laws, the victory of the State is complete but not so in regards to administration the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic, religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government.Originally, the state was a military organization. For many years, it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people. Slowly, however, the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making. One of the basic functions of the State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order; it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens. To maintain law and order the State develops means of communication. Historically, the "king''s highway" was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to commerce. In almost all countries, the State jealously maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution are rather limited. The State''s original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to police administration which is a branch of the dispensation of Justice but on its preventive side, police jurisdiction has a special character of its own, which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work. In the curfew, the State shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder. In early days, next to maintaining law and order, the State was concerned with the raising of revenue. This led eventually to modern State socialism. It was then useful to the State to establish a standard of weights and measures so that value could be generally accepted and finally the State acquired a monopoly of coinage. The regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th century, when the Black Plague killed around half of the European population.The invariable policy of the State has always being to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual. This was the policy until Adam Smith''s The Wealth of Nations was published promoting a strong public reaction against State interference. By its own action, the State raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the indigent. The State, of course, did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village, the church and the guilds, it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it. The Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that communism ran rampant in the rural areas of England. In newly developed countries such as the colonies of the British Empire, the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty in spite of the fact, that the poor classes lean heavily towards State socialism.Recognizing the great power of the State, it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general State aid.Political representation has helped to shape State administration. When the voice of the individual can be heard, the danger of arbitrary interference by the State is greatly reduced. To that extent is the increase of State activity popular. There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is necessarily for the good of the nation. In the first place, even in modern times, the State and the nation are never identical. Even where "universal suffrage" prevails, the fact remains that an extension of State administration means an increased interference of some by others, limiting freedom of action. Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same, it is sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good. Finally, the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than private enterprise. Herein lies the basic difference between Public and Business Administration; the first deals with the public weal while the second deals basically in profit but both require a great deal of education and ethical conduct to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only of business and labor but also the State and the Administration.{{cite book}}\u000aThe varieties of political experienceAccording to Aristotle, States are classified into monarchies, aristocracies, timocracies, democracies, oligarchies, and tyrannies. Due to an increase in knowledge of the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned. Generally speaking, no form of government could be considered the best if the best is considered to be the one that is most appropriate under the circumstances. All States are varieties of a single type, the sovereign State. All the Great Powers of the modern world rule on the principle of sovereignty. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an autocratic government or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a Constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten Constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the Legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. Nevertheless, the written constitution is essential. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.There are two forms of government, one a strong central government as in France and the other a local government such as the ancient divisions in England that is comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the federal government, first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1870 and in the 20th century, Australia. The Federal States introduced the new principle of agreement or contract. Compared to a federation, a confederation''s singular weakness is that it lacks judicial power.{{Citation needed}} In the American Civil War, the contention of the Confederate States that a State could secede from the Union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the Federal government in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.According to professor A. V. Dicey in An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution, the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.{{cite book}}\u000aPolitical party{{main}}\u000aA political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in electoral campaigns, educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.\u000aAs an academic disciplinePolitical science, the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of power and "power corrupts".{{cite book}} Related areas of study include political philosophy, which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, political economy, which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two, and public administration, which examines the practices of governance.The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at Columbia University, first occupied by Prussian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Francis Lieber in 1857.{{cite book}}\u000aSpectra{{cquote2}}\u000aLeft-right politics{{Main}}\u000aRecently in history, political analysts and politicians divide politics into left wing and right wing politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by Aristotle or Hobbes, for instance), and dates from the French Revolution era, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right.{{cite book}}The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in 1848. The Manifesto suggested a course of action for a proletarian revolution to overthrow the bourgeois society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a classless and stateless society.The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values tradition and social stratification while the left wing often values reform and egalitarianism, with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with social democracy or regulated capitalism.According to Norberto Bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.Bobbio, Norberto, "Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction" (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0226062465Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."Roberts and Hogwood, European Politics Today, Manchester University Press, 1997 Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Third-position economic politics in Italy, Gaullism in France, Peronism in Argentina, and National Action Politics in Mexico.\u000aAuthoritarian-libertarian politicsAuthoritarianism and libertarianism refer to the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",{{cite journal}} while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual and his property as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are anarchists, who argue for the total abolition of the state, while the purest authoritarians are totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society.For instance, classical liberalism (also known as laissez-faire liberalism,Ian Adams, Political Ideology Today (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20. or, in much of the world, simply liberalism) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and others. According to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, "the libertarian, or ''classical liberal,'' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by ''as much liberty as possible'' and ''as little government as necessary.''"What Is Libertarian?, Institute for Humane Studies\u000aWorld PoliticsThe 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the Third Reich but also the rise and fall of communism. The development of the Atomic bomb gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in World War II. Later, the development of the Hydrogen bomb became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. The United Nations has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war. "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."{{cite book}} Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is out of the question for man, "nuclear blackmail" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.{{cite book}} On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October Cuban missile crisis from the implementation of U.S. vs U.S.S.R. nuclear blackmail policy.Former President Ronald Reagan was horrified by nuclear weapons and believed in the probable existence of life on other planets. For the President, the fantasy of an invasion from outer space that would force the nations of the world to unite against a common enemy was strong enough to convince anyone that mankind could unite in a common interest such as world peace. At their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, president Reagan brought up the subject of an invasion from outer space to Gorbachev. General Powell was convinced that Reagan''s peace proposal to Gorbachev was inspired by the 1951 science-fiction film, The Day the Earth Stood Still. On September 21, 1987, Reagan told the General Assembly of the United Nations: "...I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world."{{cite book}}\u000aPolitical corruption{{main}}\u000a{{cquote2}}Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.Forms of corruption vary, but include bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft, and embezzlement. While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and trafficking, it is not restricted to these activities. The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.\u000aWorldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.African corruption ''on the wane'', 10 July 2007, BBC News A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a kleptocracy, literally meaning "rule by thieves".\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a{{Wikipedia-Books}}{{sisterlinks}}\u000aLists\u000a\u000aList of years in politics\u000aPolitics of present-day states\u000aSociology\u000a\u000a\u000aRelated

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(7,0,'Social psychology is the study of the relations between people and groups. Scholars in this interdisciplinary area are typically either psychologists or sociologists, though all social psychologists employ both the individual and the group as their units of analysis.Social Psychology, David G. Myers, McGraw Hill, 1993. ISBN 0070442924.Despite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate academic journals and professional societies. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following World War II.Sewell, W. H. (1989). Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology. Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 15. Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.The Psychology of the Social, Uwe Flick, Cambridge University Press, 1998. ISBN 0521588510.\u000aPsychology{{Portal}}\u000a{{Main}}\u000aMost psychologists are trained within psychology. Their approach to the field focuses on the individual and attempts to explain how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals are influenced by other people. Psychologically oriented researchers emphasize the immediate social situation and the interaction between person and situation variables. Their research tends to be empirical and quantitative, and it is often centered around laboratory experiments, but there are some computational modeling efforts in the field.Sun, R. (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008In its early days, with the exception of sociologists of the day, social psychology struggled for recognition as a social science.{{citation}} (Note: This and other versions of this title available at Internet Archive) One of the earliest psychologists to deal directly with this was William McDougall. Contemporary social psychology is "characterised by a fundamental commitment to the experimental method".{{citation}} While publications on social psychology tend to be dominated by American texts, efforts have been made to balance this by publication of a European perspective.{{citation}} (see Preface to first Edition for context of original publication).Psychologists who study social psychology are interested in such topics as attitudes, social cognition, cognitive dissonance, social influence, and interpersonal behaviors such as altruism and aggression. Three influential journals for the publication of research in this area are the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, and the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. There are also many other general and specialized social psychology journals.\u000aSociology{{Main}}Sociologists'' work has a greater focus on the behavior of the group, and thus examines such phenomena as interactions and exchanges at the micro-level, group dynamics and group development, and crowds at the macro-level. Sociologists are interested in the individual and group, but generally within the context of larger social structures and processes, such as social roles, race, class, gender, ethnicity, and socialization. They use a combination of qualitative research designs and quantitative methods, such as procedures for sampling and surveys.Sociologists in this area are interested in a variety of demographic, social, and cultural phenomena. Some of their major research areas are social inequality, group dynamics, social change, socialization, social identity, and symbolic interactionism.

When it refers to quantities (such as mean and median) calculated from a set of data,{{cite web}} statistics is plural, as in "These statistics are misleading."{{TOCLimit}}\u000aScope\u000aStatistics is considered by some to be a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data,Moses, Lincoln E. Think and Explain with statistics, pp. 1 - 3. Addison-Wesley, 1986. while others consider it to be a branch of mathematicsHays, William Lee, Statistics for the social sciences, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1973, p.xii, ISBN 978-0030779459 concerned with collecting and interpreting data.Statistics at Encyclopedia of Mathematics Because of its empirical roots and its focus on applications, statistics is usually considered to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics.{{cite book}}{{cite book}}Statisticians improve the quality of data with the design of experiments and survey sampling. Statistics also provides tools for prediction and forecasting using data and statistical models. Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences, government, and business.Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. This is useful in research, when communicating the results of experiments. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and are then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Inference is a vital element of scientific advance, since it provides a prediction (based in data) for where a theory logically leads. To further prove the guiding theory, these predictions are tested as well, as part of the scientific method. If the inference holds true, then the descriptive statistics of the new data increase the soundness of that hypothesis. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (a.k.a., predictive statistics) together comprise applied statistics.Anderson, , D.R.; Sweeney, D.J.; Williams, T.A.. Statistics: Concepts and Applications, pp. 5 - 9. West Publishing Company, 1986.\u000aHistory{{Main}}Some scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1663, with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt.Willcox, Walter (1938) The Founder of Statistics. Review of the International Statistical Institute 5(4):321-328. Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and the natural and social sciences.Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of probability theory by Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Probability theory arose from the study of games of chance. The method of least squares was first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1794. The use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computation, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually.\u000a\u000aOverviewIn applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, it is necessary to begin with a population or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all persons living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". A population can also be composed of observations of a process at various times, with the data from each observation serving as a different member of the overall group.  Data collected about this kind of "population" constitutes what is called a time series.For practical reasons, a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied&nbsp;\u2014 as opposed to compiling data about the entire group (an operation called census). Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting. This data can then be subjected to statistical analysis, serving two related purposes: description and inference.\u000a\u000aDescriptive statistics summarize the population data by describing what was observed in the sample numerically or graphically. Numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types (like heights or weights), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data (like race).\u000aInferential statistics uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data (hypothesis testing), estimating numerical characteristics of the data (estimation), describing associations within the data (correlation), modeling relationships within the data (regression), extrapolation, interpolation, or other modeling techniques like ANOVA, time series, and data mining.\u000a{{Quote box}}\u000aThe concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or confounding variable. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See Correlation does not imply causation.)For a sample to be used as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it is truly a representative of that overall population. Representative sampling assured, inferences and conclusions can be safely extended from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent to which the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any random trending within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods for designing experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population. Statisticians describe stronger methods as more "robust".(See experimental design.)Randomness is studied using the mathematical discipline of probability theory. Probability is used in "Mathematical statistics" (alternatively, "statistical theory") to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more generally, the properties of statistical procedures. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the  assumptions of the method.Misuse of statistics can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretation&nbsp;\u2014 subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.\u000aEven when statistics are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical significance of a trend in the data&nbsp;\u2014 which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample&nbsp;\u2014 may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.\u000aStatistical methods\u000aExperimental and observational studiesA common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables or response. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.\u000aAn experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.\u000aExperimentsThe basic steps of a statistical experiment are:\u000a\u000aPlanning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects, alternative hypotheses, and the estimated experimental variability. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects. \u000aDesign of experiments, using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables, and  randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that shall guide the performance of the experiment and that specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data.\u000aPerforming the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol. \u000aFurther examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study. \u000aDocumenting and presenting the results of the study.\u000a\u000aExperiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness. The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.{{Citation needed}}\u000aObservational studyAn example of an observational study is one that explores the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a case-control study, and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.\u000aLevels of measurement{{Main}}\u000aThere are four types of measurements or levels of measurement or measurement scales used in statistics:\u000a\u000anominal,\u000aordinal,\u000ainterval, and\u000aratio.\u000aThey have different degrees of usefulness in statistical research. Ratio measurements have both a zero value defined and the distances between different measurements defined; they provide the greatest flexibility in statistical methods that can be used for analyzing the data. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but have no meaningful zero value defined (as in the case with IQ measurements or with temperature measurements in Fahrenheit). Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values. Nominal measurements have no meaningful rank order among values.Since variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are called together as categorical variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative or continuous variables due to their numerical nature.\u000aKey terms used in statistics\u000aNull hypothesis\u000aInterpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis in that the assumption is that whatever is proposed as a cause has no effect on the variable being measured.The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a jury trial. The null hypothesis, H0, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H1, asserts that the defendant is guilty.The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H0 (status quo) stands in opposition to H1 and is maintained unless H1 is supported by evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt". However, "failure to reject H0" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily accept H0 but fails to reject H0.\u000aErrorWorking from a null hypothesis two basic forms of error are recognised:\u000a\u000aType I errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a &#34;false positive&#34;.\u000aType II errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed.\u000a\u000a\u000aConfidence intervalsMost studies will only sample part of a population and then the result is used to interpret the null hypothesis in the context of the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval of a procedure is any range such that the interval covers the true population value 95% of the time given repeated sampling under the same conditions. If these intervals span a value (such as zero) where the null hypothesis would be confirmed then this can indicate that any observed value has been seen by chance. For example a drug that gives a mean increase in heart rate of 2 beats per minute but has 95% confidence intervals of -5 to 9  for its increase may well have no effect whatsoever.The 95% confidence interval is often misinterpreted as the probability that the true value lies between the upper and lower limits given the observed sample. However this quantity is more a credible interval available only from Bayesian statistics.\u000aSignificanceStatistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question asked of them. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refer to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the p-value).When interpreting an academic paper reference to the significance of a result when referring to the statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result means anything in real world terms. (For example in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect such that the drug will be unlikely to help anyone given it in a noticeable way.)\u000aExamplesSome well-known statistical tests and procedures are:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSpecialized disciplines{{Main}}\u000aSome fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have specialized terminology. These disciplines include:\u000a\u000a\u000aIn addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:\u000a\u000aStatistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in statistical process control or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.\u000aStatistical computing\u000a{{Main}}The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear models (such as neural networks) as well as the creation of new types, such as generalized linear models and multilevel models.Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling, such as permutation tests and the bootstrap, while techniques such as Gibbs sampling have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available.\u000aMisuse{{Main}}There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter. A famous saying attributed to Benjamin Disraeli is, "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." Harvard President Lawrence Lowell wrote in 1909 that statistics, "...like veal pies, are good if you know the person that made them, and are sure of the ingredients."If various studies appear to contradict one another, then the public may come to distrust such studies. For example, one study may suggest that a given diet or activity raises blood pressure, while another may suggest that it lowers blood pressure. The discrepancy can arise from subtle variations in experimental design, such as differences in the patient groups or research protocols, which are not easily understood by the non-expert. (Media reports usually omit this vital contextual information entirely, because of its complexity.)By choosing (or rejecting, or modifying) a certain sample, results can be manipulated. Such manipulations need not be malicious or devious; they can arise from unintentional biases of the researcher. The graphs used to summarize data can also be misleading.Deeper criticisms come from the fact that the hypothesis testing approach, widely used and in many cases required by law or regulation, forces one hypothesis (the null hypothesis) to be "favored," and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance. (See criticism of hypothesis testing and controversy over the null hypothesis.)One response is by giving a greater emphasis on the p-value than simply reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected at the given level of significance. The p-value, however, does not indicate the size of the effect. Another increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or p-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.\u000aStatistics applied to mathematics or the arts\u000aTraditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-standardized methodology that was "required learning" in most sciences. This has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically. Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.\u000a\u000aIn number theory, scatter plots of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.\u000aMethods of statistics including predictive methods in forecasting, are combined with chaos theory and fractal geometry to create video works that are considered to have great beauty.\u000aThe process art of Jackson Pollock relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed. With the advent of computers, methods of statistics were applied to formalize such distribution driven natural processes, in order to make and analyze moving video art.\u000aMethods of statistics may be used predicatively in performance art, as in a card trick based on a Markov process that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.\u000aStatistics is used to predicatively create art, as in applications of statistical mechanics with the statistical or stochastic music invented by Iannis Xenakis, where the music is performance-specific.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(9,0,'Computer-supported collaboration (CSC) research focuses on technology that affects groups, organizations, communities and societies, e.g., voice mail and text chat. It grew from cooperative work study of supporting people''s work activities and working relationships. As net technology increasingly supported a wide range of recreational and social activities, consumer markets expanded the user base, enabling more and more people to connect online to create what researchers have called a computer supported cooperative work, which includes "all contexts in which technology is used to mediate human activities such as communication, coordination, cooperation, competition, entertainment, games, art, and music" (from CSCW 2004).\u000aScope of the field\u000aFocused on outputThe subfield computer-mediated communication deals specifically with how humans use "computers" (or digital media) to form, support and maintain relationships with others (social uses), regulate information flow (instructional uses), and make decisions (including major financial and political ones). It does not focus on common work products or other "collaboration" but rather on "meeting" itself, and on trust. By contrast, CSC is focused on the output from, rather than the character or emotional consequences of, meetings or relationships, reflecting the difference between "communication" and "collaboration".\u000aFocused on contracts and rendezvousUnlike communication research, which focuses on trust, or computer science, which focuses on truth and logic, CSC focuses on cooperation and collaboration and decision making theory, which are more concerned with rendezvous and contract. For instance, auctions and market systems, which rely on bid and ask relationships, are studied as part of CSC but not usually as part of communication.The term CSC emerged in the 1990s to replace the following terms:\u000a\u000aworkgroup computing, which emphasizes technology over the work being supported and seems to restrict inquiry to small organizational units\u000agroupware, which became a commercial buzzword and was used to describe many badly designed systems{{Citation needed}}\u000acomputer supported cooperative work, which is the name of a conference and which seems only to address research into experimental systems and the nature of workplaces and organizations doing &#34;work&#34;, as opposed, say, to play or war.\u000a\u000a\u000aCollaboration is not softwareTwo different types of software are sometimes differentiated:\u000a\u000asocial software, which produces social ties as its primary output, e.g., a social network service\u000acollaborative software, which produces a collaborative deliverable, e.g., a political wiki producing a platform\u000a\u000aBase technologies such as netnews, email, chat and wiki could be described as either "social" or "collaborative". Those who say "social" seem to focus on so-called "virtual community" while those who say "collaborative" seem to be more concerned with content management and the actual output. While software may be designed to achieve closer social ties or specific deliverables, it is hard to support collaboration without also enabling relationships to form, and hard to support a social interaction without some kind of shared co-authored works.\u000aMay include gamesAccordingly, the differentiation between social and collaborative software may also be stated as that between "play" and "work". Some theorists hold that a play ethic should apply, and that work must become more game-like or play-like in order to make using computers a more comfortable experience. The study of MUDs and MMRPGs in the 1980s and 1990s led many to this conclusion, which is now not controversial.True multi-player computer games can be considered a simple form of collaboration, but only a few theorists include this as part of CSC.\u000aNot just about "computing"{{Essay-like}}\u000aThe term social computing is used mostly at IBM to describe the field, in an attempt to invoke existing social conventions or contexts as opposed to technological attributes: the use of e-mail for maintaining social relationships, instant messaging for daily microcoordination at one''s workplace, or weblogs as a community building tool. Most researchers argue that these are all forms of collaboration, not forms of "computing", making this variant term an oxymoron: whatever is "social" about software, it is not the "computing" aspect. The term has not caught on much beyond IBM.However, the relatively new areas of evolutionary computing, massively-parallel algorithms, and even "artificial life" explore the solution of problems by the evolving interaction of large numbers of small actors, or agents, or decision-makers who interact in a largely unconstrained fashion. The "side-effect" of the interaction may be a solution of interest, such as a new sorting algorithm; or there may be a permanent residual of the interaction, such as the setting of weights in a neural network that has now been "tuned" or "trained" to repeatedly solve a specific problem, such as making a decision about granting credit to a person, or distinguishing a diseased plant from a healthy one. Connectionism is a study of systems in which the learning is stored in the linkages, or connections, not in what is normally thought of as content. This larger definition of "computing", in which not just the data, or the metadata, or the context of the data, but the computer itself is being "processed", makes the term "social computing" have a whole different meaning. The repeated use of the "blogosphere" to process daily news has a "side-effect" of building up linkage maps, trusted sources, RSS aggregator feeds, etc., so that the overall system is, in some sense, learning how to do something better, more rapidly, and more easily.In control systems theory, it has been shown that closed-loop feedback systems are vastly more robust than open-loop system. The blogosphere has been criticized for having "echos" or repeatedly cycling certain ideas, but the upside is that there are simultaneous closed-loop feedback paths across a wide spectrum of distance and time-constants. These issues of computability and algorithm-order are classic computer-science issues and, in that sense, social computing is again a legitimate "computing" subject, even if it involves flexible collaboration as part of the "hardware". An analogy might be to imagine a "computer" built entirely of field-programmable gate-arrays, where not just the data and the program itself can be modified in flight (as in LISP, where programs and data are indistinguishable), but the hardware and logic and rules of operation also can be modified real-time during a "computation".If the collaboration is over a large distance and many time-zones, the system will probably encounter significant differences in context between the components, resulting in a whole new set of design and support problems and behaviors, especially misunderstanding of what is taken as implicit or obvious by different collaborators, and therefore not explicitly stated. Such differences may be cultural, geographic, hierarchical, etc. For example, when Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S. in Fall, 2005, there were substantial collaboration and communication difficulties between Federal, State, and local officials. A significant portion of those difficulties were classic issues that very frequently result from attempts to collaborate over a distance, and from people at one level in an organization trying to collaborate with people at an entirely different level of an organization, with each group having different meanings to what "the problem" is that is being addressed and what time-scale is relevant. Computer-supported collaboration research includes academic research into how to minimize, or at least recognize that class of problem in collaboration and take it into account. Similar problems may occur if a conversation or collaboration occurs when it is a work day at one site or in one country, and already a week-end or holiday in another site, and the parties have different levels of stress and focus. These problems are analogies to "flame wars", the abrupt hostility that has been observed to occur when e-mail is used for a conversation, when the parties are no longer getting direct feedback from watching each other''s body language. A final difference between computer-supported collaboration and classic "computing" is that a computer typically remains a closed system, focusing only on what is already "inside the box", and only dealing with it in an abstract or mental fashion. Collaboration that occurs over a significant period of space and time shares properties of "active vision", where the actions possible are more than just analyzing an incoming TV image of an object of interest, but include walking over to the object, picking it up, turning it over, smashing it open, etc. The collaborating "units" are human beings, typically, who remain partly involved in the collaboration, and partly both sensing and actively changing the world around them. A collaborative discussion of baking cookies could include a period in which participants left the room to actually bake such cookies and try them out. A collaborative discussion of politics could include actually voting and changing the political landscape. This inclusion of both active sensors and active "effectors" is again a difference from "computing" that, at a minimum, makes this field at least as complex as "robotics". Also, as stated earlier, generally a computer is unaltered by the program it is running or the data it is processing, but a collaboration of people and groups is typically substantially and permanently altered by the nature of problems it works on, the enjoyment or frustration with the working process, and the outcome of the work. This lasting residual "side-effect" or "effect" of one "cycle" of the collaboration then may alter the way in which the collaboration tool is use for the next "cycle", as people learn how to use this new method, so short-term, single-session or single-problem studies of collaboration tools may be very misleading as to what the longer-term outcomes may be. Imagine that your desktop computer, after a while, decided it didn''t really like to do word-processing any more and preferred to work on addition, and that every time you tried to write e-mail the computer stopped mid-course to become obsessed with doing word-counts. Analogous behaviors in CSC, as with "game-theory", make studying almost any system or design problem frustratingly complicated: either the problems involved seem to be "toy" problems that are doable but unrealistically simple, or the problems become so complex that analysis is impossible.A "computer" doesn''t generally care whether the answer to a problem is "5" or "25", "yes" or "no," but humans involved in a group decision-making process may care very much about the outcome, and the various answers can have winners and losers with potentially very high stakes. At a minimum, this introduces substantial bias into the analysis of any data, as people will tend to selectively see facts that support the conclusions they personally prefer. In a collaboration within a single hospital between multiple clinicians, mediated by an "electronic medical record", there may actually be a substantial amount of dispute and negotiation going on among, say, a group focusing on treating diabetes and another group focusing on treating congestive heart failure. The "collaboration" may actually be much more of a "competition" to frame and define the problem in terms that result in favorable outcomes. Again, this makes CSC design work far more complicated than simply trying to get a group of sensors or computers to share data and work together correctly. In fact, in some cases, participants may have a strong vested interest in the status quo and prefer as an outcome that the "problem" not be solved. A successful CSC system, in their minds, would be one that prevented the solution of the problem supposedly being addressed collaboratively, perhaps while giving a misleading appearance of cooperative effort. This factor complicates research into whether a CSC system is well-designed or not.For example, in some countries national political elections could be viewed, abstractly, as heavily technology-mediated (and "computer supported") processes, including information distribution, discussion, debate, and an outcome resolution process - yet there may not be a unanimous opinion as to whether this process "works" or "is broken." It is difficult to improve or redesign a system if people can''t even agree on whether the system works now or not. The implications of this is that CSC systems are inextricably embedded in social contexts and have to simultaneously address a specific problem, plus the issue of whether collaboration this way increases the ability to address future problems, plus the issue of what really defines which problems need to be addressed in the first place and the relative priority of those problems.And, not only is there difference and potential competition between parties across organizational and cultural and geographic dimensions\u2014opinions on all those subjects may differ, and generally will differ, even within any given organization at different hierarchical levels. What works for workers may not work for management. What works for middle-management may not work for upper-management. What works for management may not work for the stockholders. What works for the company may not work for the country. A CSC system has to handle not just "content processing" but also "context processing" in that sense, sorting out the different nested and overlapping value-laden reference frames as well as the data and "the explicitly identified problem" within those reference frames. Part of this is a very abstract technical problem, faced by researchers in distributed artificial intelligence, in getting, say, 20 different surveillance robotic vehicles to talk to each other and compare notes - which is in itself a hard problem. Add to that complexity a new factor that, say, each of the robots has a hidden agenda and is not being totally honest about what it shares. If the preceding discussion gives the impression that CSC problems are extraordinarily hard to solve, that''s correct. In fact, they have been described as "wicked" problems, not only because they are immensely complicated when addressed, but because they look so simple from the outside and are generally under-appreciated. For example, building a disaster-response communication system is vastly more complex than just getting a unified frequency for different agencies to use to communicate with each other, because the words, meanings, contexts, values, and agendas all also have to be communicated and resolved, across space, across time, and across a 14-level hierarchy from the national leader to the front-line responder. The view of a scene from an infection-control specialist''s viewpoint and from a military or police viewpoint may suggest exactly opposite actions regarding "rounding up people and concentrating them at the stadium." The ability of a CSC system to facilitate wise decisions and action in that sort of situation might require the type of action described by the Harvard Negotiation Project in the book "Getting to Yes", where "positions" have to be abstracted to "interests", perhaps repeatedly, until a level is reached at which agreement and a common ground can be found between groups that appear, on the surface, to be hopelessly deadlocked. It is an open research question as to what features of a CSC system could simply allow that type of discussion to occur, let alone facilitate it. Very high bandwidth and multiple "back-channel" communication pathways have often proven to be helpful. Apparently very simple things, such as sufficient magnification and resolution on video screens to be able to actually see another person''s eyes clearly, can have a dramatic effect on the ability of a system to support trust-building and collaboration at a distance.\u000aRequires protocolsCommunication essential to the collaboration, or disruptive of it, is studied in CSC proper. It is somehow hard to find or draw a line between a well-defined process and general human communications. Reflecting desired organization protocols and business processes and governance norms directly, so that regulated communication (the collaboration) can be told apart from free-form interactions, is important to collaboration research, if only to know where to stop the study of work and start the study of people. The subfield CMC or computer-mediated communication deals with human relationships.\u000aBasic tasksTasks undertaken in this field resemble those of any social science, but with a special focus on systems integration and groups:CSCW 2004 tutorials\u000a\u000aDiscover the multidisciplinary nature of computer supported cooperative work \u000aDiscuss experiences with technologies that support communication, collaboration, and coordination \u000aUnderstand behavioral, social, and organizational challenges to developing and using these technologies \u000aLearn successful development and usage approaches \u000aAnticipate future trends in technology use and global social impacts \u000aAnalyze CMC systems and interaction via social software \u000aDesign CMC systems to facilitate desirable outcomes \u000aApply CMC analysis and visualization tools \u000aFind uses of video conferencing, if any\u000aApply social ergonomics \u000aWork environment design and A/V considerations \u000aImprove audio and video encoding - from grainy thumbnails to HD \u000aImprove and integrate common video conferencing tools \u000aAnalyze work processes, e.g. with the support of video monitoring\u000aDeploy and evaluate systems for use in particular work contexts\u000aTake theoretical perspectives to fieldwork, dealing with social complexity. \u000aPerforming observational studies\u000aWork in commercial and industrial settings, domestic environments and public spaces\u000a\u000aProblems of method, communication and comprehension in collaborations between ethnographer and system developer are also of special concern.A 2004 list of "coordination and communication technologies" included:\u000a\u000a&#34;Innovations and experiences with Intranets, the Internet, WWW&#34;\u000a&#34;Innovative installations: CSCW and the arts&#34;\u000a&#34;Innovative technologies and architectures to support group activity, awareness and telepresence&#34;\u000a&#34;Social and organizational effects of introducing technologies&#34; \u000a&#34;Theoretical aspects of coordination and communication&#34;\u000a&#34;Methodologies and tools for design and analysis of collaborative practices&#34;, e.g. social network analysis\u000a&#34;Ethnographic and case studies of work practice&#34;\u000a&#34;Working with and through collections of heterogeneous technologies&#34;\u000a&#34;Emerging issues for global systems&#34;\u000a\u000aPlenary addresses on Open Source Society and Hacking Law suggest a bold, civilization-building, ambition for this research.Less ambitiously, specific CSC fields are often studied under their own names with no reference to the more general field of study, focusing instead on the technology with only minimal attention to the collaboration implied, e.g. video games, videoconferences. Since some specialized devices exist for games or conferences that do not include all of the usual boot image capabilities of a true "computer", studying these separately may be justified. There is also separate study of e-learning, e-government, e-democracy and telemedicine. The subfield telework also often stands alone.\u000aHistory\u000aEarly researchThe development of this field reaches back to the late 1960s and the visionary assertions of Ted Nelson, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Glenn Gould, Nicholas Negroponte and others who saw a potential for digital media to ultimately redefine how we work. A very early thinker, Vannevar Bush, even suggested in 1945 As We May Think.\u000aNumbersThe inventor of the computer "mouse", Douglas Engelbart, studied collaborative software (especially revision control in computer-aided software engineering and the way a graphic user interface could enable interpersonal communication) in the 1960s. Alan Kay worked on Smalltalk, which embodied these principles, in the 1970s, and by the 1980s it was well regarded and considered to represent the future of user interfaces.However, at this time, collaboration capabilities were limited. As few computers had even local area networks, and processors were slow and expensive, the idea of using them simply to accelerate and "augment" human communication was eccentric in many situations. Computers processed numbers, not text, and the collaboration was in general devoted only to better and more accurate handling of numbers.\u000aTextThis began to change in the 1980s with the rise of personal computers, modems and more general use of the Internet for non-academic purposes. People were clearly collaborating online with all sorts of motives, but using a small suite of tools (LISTSERV, netnews, IRC, MUD) to support all of those motives. Research at this time focused on textual communication, as there was little or no exchange of audio and video representations. Some researchers, such as Brenda Laurel, emphasized how similar online dialogue was to a play, and applied Aristotle''s model of drama to their analysis of computers for collaboration.Another major focus was hypertext&mdash;in its pre-HTML, pre-WWW form, focused more on links and semantic web applications than on graphics. Such systems as Superbook, NoteCards, KMS and the much simpler HyperTies and HyperCard were early examples of collaborative software used for e-learning.\u000aAudioIn the 1990s, the rise of broadband networks and the dotcom boom presented the Internet as mass media to a whole generation. By the late 1990s, VoIP and net phones and audio chat had emerged. For the first time, people used computers primarily as communications, not "computing" devices. This, however, had long been anticipated, predicted, and studied by experts in the field.Video collaboration is not usually studied. Online videoconferencing and webcams have been studied in small scale use for decades but since people simply do not have built-in facilities to create video together directly, they are properly a communication, not collaboration, concern.\u000aACM conferencesThe Computer Supported Cooperative Work conferences are held by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group in Computer-Human Interaction biannually in the fall since 1984. The most recent conference was in 2008. Starting with the next conference in 2010, CSCW becomes an annual event held in February. In the beginning, the conferences were small affairs focused on such specific applications as hypertext&mdash;which soon got its own conference.The conference series began when, according to Jonathan Grudin: "Paul Cashman and Irene Greif organized a workshop of people from various disciplines who shared an interest in how people work, with an eye to understanding how technology could support them. They coined the term computer-supported cooperative work to describe this common interest... thousands of researchers and developers have been drawn to it."According to Grudin, "an earlier approach to group support, Office Automation, had run out of steam. The problems were not primarily technical, although technical challenges certainly existed. The key problem was understanding system requirements. In the mid-1960s, tasks such as filling seats on airplane flights or printing payroll checks had been translated into requirements that resulted (with some trial and error) in successful mainframe systems. In the mid-1970s, minicomputers promised to support groups and organizations in more sophisticated, interactive ways: Office Automation was born. Single-user applications such as word processors and spreadsheets succeeded; office automation tried to integrate and extend these successes to support groups and departments. But what were the precise requirements for such systems?"\u000aPioneersOther pioneers in the field included Ted Nelson, Austin Henderson, Kjeld Schmidt, Lucy Suchman, Sara Bly, Randy Farmer, and many "economists, social psychologists, anthropologists, organizational theorists, educators, and anyone else who can shed light on group activity." - Grudin.\u000aPolitics and businessIn this century, the focus has shifted to sociology, political science, management science and other business disciplines. This reflects the use of the net in politics and business and even other high-stakes collaboration situations, such as war.\u000aWarThough it is not studied at the ACM conferences, military use of collaborative software has been a very major impetus of work on maps and data fusion, used in military intelligence. A number of conferences and journals are concerned primarily with the military use of digital media and the security implications thereof.\u000aCurrent researchCurrent research in computer-supported collaboration includes:\u000aVoice command"Computer..." - spoken often on every Star Trek episodeEarly researchers, such as Bill Buxton, had focused on non-voice gestures (like humming or whistling) as a way to communicate with the machine while not interfering too directly with speech directed at a person. Some researchers believed voice as command interfaces were bad for this reason, because they encouraged speaking as if to a "slave". A notable innovation was the emergence of the video prototype - Apple Computer used it to test the likely user acceptance of a voice interface. They had very mixed results, and decided not to pursue such an interface at the time (late 1980s).\u000aLink semanticsWhat''s a "link"? What am I saying when I link something, or remove a link to something? Is there one taxonomy of all types of links? Is there one per industry? Per profession? Per culture? Since the 1960s, researchers had been insisting that links should have types&mdash;that, for instance, a link that "contradicts" another should be easy to differentiate from one that "supports" another: all of the early hypertext systems had schemes for doing exactly this, somehow.HTML supports simple link types with the REL tag and REV tag. Some standards for using these on the WWW were proposed, most notably in 1994, by people very familiar with earlier work in SGML. However, no such scheme has ever been adopted by a large number of web users, and the "semantic web" remains unrealized. Heroic attempts such as crit.org have sometimes collapsed totally.A lot of CSC researchers ask why, and why the interest in applying a semantic web standard should continue despite so many failed attempts.\u000aIdentity and privacyWho am I, online? Can an account be assumed to be the same as a person''s real-life identity? Should I have rights to continue any relationship I start through a service, even if I''m not using it any longer? Who owns information about the user? What about others (not the user) who are affected by information revealed or learned by me?Online identity and privacy concerns, especially identity theft, have grown to dominate the CSCW agenda in more recent years. The separate Computers, Freedom and Privacy conferences deal with larger social questions, but basic concerns that apply to systems and work process design tend still to be discussed as part of CSC research.\u000aOnline decision makingWhere decisions are made based exclusively or mostly on information received or exchanged online, how do people rendezvous to signal their trust in it, and willingness to make major decisions on it? Team consensus decision making in software engineering, and the role of revision control, revert, reputation and other functions, has always been a major focus of CSC: There is no software without someone writing it. Presumably, those who do write it must understand something about collaboration in their own team. This design and code, however, is only one form of collaborative content.\u000aCollaborative contentWhat are the most efficient and effective ways to share information? Can creative networks form through online meeting/work systems? Can people have equal power relationships in building content?By the late 1990s, with the rise of wikis (a simple repository and data dictionary that was easy for the public to use), the way consensus applied to joint editing, meeting agendas and so on had become a major concern. Different wikis adopted different social and pseudopolitical structures to combat the problems caused by conflicting points of view and differing opinions on content.\u000aCollaboratoriesA report on collaboratories, prepared under the auspices of the National Research Council, described a collaboratory as a  . . . center without walls in which the nation''s researchers can perform research without regard to geographical location\u2014interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, and accessing information from digital libraries.Tools and techniques for designing and running effective "collaboratories" among researchers with similar interests and a common language have been developed over the last 20 years and are well documented in the literature. Much of this hard-won knowledge regards process as much as it does technology.\u000a\u000aIn Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work, Johndan Johnson-Eilola describes a specific computer-supported collaboriatin space: The Smart Board. According to Johnson-Eilola, a \u201cSmart Board system provides a 72-inch, rear projection, touchscreen, intelligent whiteboard surface for work\u201d (79). In Datacloud, Johnson-Eilola asserts that \u201c[w]e are attempting to understand how users move within information spaces, how users can exist within information spaces rather than merely gaze at them, and how information spaces must be shared with others rather than being private, lived within rather than simply visited\u201d (82). He explains how the Smart Board system offers an information space that allows his students to engage in active collaboration. He makes three distinct claims regarding the functionality of the technology: 1) The Smart Board allows users to work with large amounts of information, 2) It offers an information space that invites active collaboration, 3) The work produced is often \u201cdynamic and contingent\u201d (82).Johnson-Eilola, Johndan. Datacloud: Toward a New Theory of Online Work. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press, Inc., 2005. Print.\u000a\u000aJohnson-Eilola further explains that with the Smart Board \u201c\u2026information work becom[es] a bodied experience\u201d (81). Users have the opportunity to engage with\u2014inhabit\u2014the technology by direct manipulation. Moreover, this space allows for more than one user; essentially, it invites multiple users.\u000aWorkflowHow can work be made simpler, less prone to error, easier to learn? What role do diagrams and notations play in improving work output? What words do workers come to work already understanding, what do they misunderstand, and how can we get them using the same words to mean the same thing?Study of content management, enterprise taxonomy and the other core instructional capital of the learning organization has become increasingly important due to ISO standards and the use of continuous improvement methods. Natural language and application commands tend to converge over time, becoming reflexive user interfaces. A concern that overlaps with OOPSLA.\u000aTelework and human capital managementWhere are the workers? Do we care? How do we coordinate them? How do we hire them, fire them, help them find the right thing to do next?The role of social network analysis and outsourcing services like e-lance, especially when combined in services like LinkedIn, is of particular concern in human capital management&mdash;again, especially in the software industry, where it is becoming more and more normal to run 24x7 globally-distributed shops.\u000aProductivity paradoxDo computers really do anything useful for human beings at all?Despite a widely held belief that more automation means more worker productivity, almost all studies of actual attempts to add more "computer power" to the white-collar workplace demonstrated that productivity did not improve, and in many cases went down. Yet, the "investment" in computers and software continued. This productivity paradox remains unresolved.

It is used to ensure normality throughout the medium on which it is being conducted.  Common uses of moderation include:\u000a\u000aEnsuring consistency and accuracy in the marking of student assessments.\u000aA moderator may remove unsuitable contributions from the website, forum or IRC channel they represent in accordance with their moderation system.\u000aA more proactive nuance is found in the Methodist church&#39;s use of the term for the heads of its conferences.\u000aA neutron moderator is used to slow down neutrons in a nuclear reactor.\u000aA way of life started at The American School In Japan by Chaiken of Biology. This lifestyle emphasizes perfect amounts of everything, not indulging in too much of one thing, hence moderation.\u000a\u000aModeration is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of Apollo at Delphi bore the inscription Meden Agan - ''Nothing in excess''. Doing something "in moderation" means not doing it excessively. For instance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food groups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to harmless levels. Similarly in Christianity, moderationism is the position that drinking alcoholic beverages temperately is permissible, though drunkenness is forbidden (see Christianity and alcohol). Moderation is a characteristic of the Swedish national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym. \u000aIslam also consider moderation as a preferred way of life, even when applying religious norms. Moderate Muslims adhere to the concept of contextual relativism as a way to grasp meaning from the Quran. They also understand the Quran as a whole opposed to a discrete understanding. Furthermore, Moderate Muslims also follow various types of Hadith (prophet Mohammed''s sayings) that favor moderation and view muhammad as an ideal example of a moderate Muslim and Human. de:Moderation\u000aes:Moderaci\u00f3n','Moderation','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation')
INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(11,0,'{{selfref}}Fundraising or fund raising (also development) is the process of soliciting and gathering contributions as money or other resources, by requesting donations from individuals, businesses, charitable foundations, or governmental agencies (see also crowd funding). Although fundraising typically refers to efforts to gather money for non-profit organizations, it is sometimes used to refer to the identification and solicitation of investors or other sources of capital for-profit enterprises.\u000aOrganizationsFundraising is a significant way that non-profit organizations may obtain the money for their operations. These operations can involve a very broad array of concerns such as religious or philanthropic groups such as research organizations, public broadcasters, and political campaigns.Some examples of charitable organizations include student scholarship merit awards for athletic or academic achievement, humanitarian concerns, disaster relief, human rights, research, and other social issues.\u000aProfessional fundraisersMany non-profit organizations take advantage of the services of professional fundraisers. These fundraisers may be paid for their services either through fees unrelated to the amounts of money to be raised, or by retaining a percentage of raised funds (percentage-based compensation). The latter approach is expressly forbidden under the Code of Ethics of the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), a professional membership body.{{cite web}}Many non-profit organizations nonetheless engage fundraisers who are paid a percentage of the funds they raise. In the United States, this ratio of funds retained to funds passed on to the non-profit is subject to reporting to a number of state''s Attorneys General.For example, {{cite web}}  This ratio is highly variable and subject to change over time and place, and it is a point of contention between a segment of the general public and the non-profit organizations.It should be noted that the term "professional fundraiser" is in many cases a legislated term referring to third-party firms whose services are contracted for; whereas "fundraising professionals" or development officers are often individuals or staff at charitable non-profits.  Although potentially confusing, the distinction is an important one to note.\u000aReligious organizations\u000aEqually important are fundraising efforts by virtually every recognized religious group throughout the world. These efforts are organized on a local, national, and global level. Sometimes, such funds will go exclusively toward assisting the basic needs of others, while money may at other times be used only for evangelism. Usually, religious organizations mix the two, which can sometimes cause tension.\u000aPolitical campaignsFundraising also plays a major role in political campaigns.  This fact, despite numerous campaign finance reform laws, continues to be a highly controversial topic in American politics. Political action committees (PACs) are the best-known organizations that back candidates and political parties, though others such as 527 groups also have an impact. Some advocacy organizations conduct fundraising for or against policy issues in an attempt to influence legislation.\u000aPublic broadcasting\u000aWhile public broadcasters are completely government-funded in much of the world, there are many countries where some funds must come from donations from the public.  Pledge drives commonly occur about three times each year, usually lasting one to two weeks each time. Viewership and listenership often declines significantly during funding periods, so special programming may be aired in order to keep regular viewers and listeners interested.\u000aTaxation\u000aOrganizations in the United States established for charitable purposes are allowed to raise funds from many sources. They are given a specific designation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), commonly noted as 501(c)(3) organizations. Other nonprofits such as fraternal associations have different IRS designations, and may or may not be eligible to raise funds. Financial information on many nonprofits, including all nonprofits that file annual IRS 990 forms is available from GuideStar.\u000aTypes\u000aMany non-profit organizations receive some annual funding from a financial endowment, which is a sum of money that is invested to generate an annual return. Although endowments may be created when a sizable gift is received from an individual or family, often as directed in a will upon the death of a family member, they more typically are the result of many gifts over time from a variety of sources.Non-profit organizations also raise funds through competing for grant funding.  Grant (money) is offered by governmental units and private foundations/ charitable trusts to non-profit organizations for the benefit of all parties to the transaction.A capital campaign is when fundraising is conducted to raise major sums for a building or endowment, and generally keep such funds separate from operating funds. These campaigns encourage donors to give more than they would normally give and tap donors, especially corporations and foundations who would not otherwise give.Special events are another method of raising funds. These range from formal dinners to benefit concerts to walkathons. Events are used to increase visibility and support for an organization as well as raising funds.Fundraising in the online sphere allows a variety of approaches. Examples can be found at Better The World, Network for Good, Google Checkout and MissionFish (donations), Justgiving (online sponsorship), the Facebook "Causes" application (social networking), and The Big Give (matched funding).While fundraising often involves the donation of money as an out-right gift, money may also be generated by selling a product of some kind, also known as product fundraising.  Girl Scouts of the USA are well-known for selling cookies in order to generate funds. It is also common to see on-line impulse sales links to be accompanied by statements that a proportion of proceeds will be directed to a particular charitable foundation.When goods or professional services are donated to an organization rather than cash, this is called an in-kind gift.A number of charities and non-profit organizations are increasingly using the internet as a means to raise funds; this practice is referred to as online fundraising. For example the NSPCC operates a search engine which generates funds via Pay per click links, and Better The World operates tools allowing funds to be raised via members viewing ethical ads on a browser sidebar and/or blog widget.Alabama Charity Blog url=http://alabamacharity.wordpress.com | accessdate=April 22, 2010 | dateformat=mdy }}Some of the most substantial fundraising efforts in the United States are conducted by colleges and universities. Commonly the fundraising, or "development" / "advancement," program, makes a distinction between annual fund appeals and major campaigns.The donor base (often called a file) for higher education includes alumni, parents, friends, private foundations, and corporations. Gifts of appreciated property are important components of such efforts because the tax advantage they confer on the donor encourages larger gifts. The process of soliciting appreciated assets is called planned giving.The classic development program at institutions of higher learning include prospect identification, prospect research and verification of the prospect''s viability, cultivation, solicitation, and finally stewardship, the latter being the process of keeping donors informed about how past support has been used.\u000aRelationship buildingOften called donor cultivation, relationship building is the foundation on which most fundraising takes place.{{cite web}} Most development strategies divide donors into categories based on annual gifts. For instance, major donors are those that give at the highest level of the organization''s fundraising scale and mid-level donors are in the middle.\u000aMore sophisticated strategies use tools to overlay demographic and other market segmentation data against their database of donors in order to more precisely customize communication and more effectively target resources.{{cite web}} Research by Peter Maple in the UKMaple P,(2003) Marketing Strategy for Effective Fundraising, DSC shows that charities generally underinvest in good marketing research spending around a quarter of what an equivalent sized for profit company might spend.Donor relations and stewardship "Stewardship & Donor Relations," Entrepreneur.com professionals support fundraisers by recognizing and thanking donors in a fashion that will cultivate future giving to nonprofit organizations. The Association of Donor Relations Professionals (ADRP) Association of Donor Relations Professionals is the first community of stewardship and donor relations professionals in the United States and Canada.Recent research by Adrian Sargeant and the Association of Fundraising Professionals'' Fundraising Effectiveness Project suggests the sector has a long way to go in improving the quality of donor relations. The sector generally loses 50\u201360% of its newly acquired donors between their first and second donations and one in three, year on year thereafter. The economics of regular or sustained giving are rather different, but even then organizations routinely lose 30% of their donors from one year to the next.Sargeant A and Jay E (2004) Building Donor Loyalty, Jossey Bass, San Francisco.\u000aEvents\u000a\u000aBand Aid (1984), Live Aid (1985) and Sport Aid (1986), for famine relief in Ethiopia\u000aWalk Against Want in Australia\u000aRed Nose Day in the United Kingdom\u000aChristian Aid Week in the United Kingdom and Ireland\u000aIf Day (1942) in Canada\u000a\u000a\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aAccountable Fundraising\u000aAmerican Institute of Philanthropy\u000aCrowd funding\u000aFriendraising\u000aFundraiser\u000aOnline fundraising\u000aDirect mail fundraising\u000a\u000a\u000aNotes and references{{Reflist}}\u000aExternal links{{Wiktionary}}{{charity}}\u000a\u000acs:Fundraising\u000ada:Fundraising\u000ade:Fundraising\u000aes:Recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos\u000aeo:Akiro de financa subteno\u000afr:Collecte de fonds\u000ait:Raccolta di fondi\u000ahe:\u05d4\u05ea\u05e8\u05de\u05d4\u000alt:Kapitalo pritraukimas\u000anl:Contributie\u000apl:Fundraising\u000apt:Fundraising\u000aru:\u0424\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0433\u000asr:\u0424\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0458\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0433\u000auk:\u0424\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0433\u000ayi:\u05e9\u05e0\u05d0\u05e8\u000azh:\u7c4c\u6b3e','Fundraising','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundraising')
INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(12,0,'Recommender systems, recommendation systems or recommendation engines form or work from a specific type of information filtering system technique that attempts to recommend information items (films, television, video on demand, musicHow Computers Know What We Want \u2014 Before We Do, books, news, images, web pages, etc) that are likely to be of interest to the user. Typically, a recommender system compares a user profile to some reference characteristics, and seeks to predict the ''rating'' that a user would give to an item they had not yet considered. These characteristics may be from the information item (the content-based approach) or the user''s social environment (the collaborative filtering approach).\u000aOverviewWhen building the user''s profile a distinction is made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection.Examples of explicit data collection include the following:\u000a\u000aAsking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\u000aAsking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\u000aPresenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the best one.\u000aAsking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes. \u000a\u000aExamples of implicit data collection include the following:\u000a\u000aObserving the items that a user views in an online store.\u000aAnalyzing item/user viewing times{{citation}}.\u000aKeeping a record of the items that a user purchases online. \u000aObtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\u000aAnalyzing the user&#39;s social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes \u000a\u000aThe recommender system compares the collected data to similar and not similar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the user. Several commercial and non-commercial examples are listed in the article on collaborative filtering systems. Montaner provides the first overview of recommender systems, from an intelligent agents perspective. {{citation}}. Adomavicius provides a new overview of recommender systems.{{citation}}.  Herlocker provides an overview of evaluation techniques for recommender systems.{{citation}}.Recommender systems are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover items they might not have found by themselves.  Interestingly enough, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.\u000aAlgorithmsOne of the most commonly used algorithms in recommender systems is the k-nearest neighborhood approach.{{citation}}.. In a social network, a particular user''s neighborhood with similar taste or interest can be found by calculating Pearson Correlation, by collecting the preference data of top-N nearest neighbors of the particular user (weighted by similarity), the user''s preference can be predicted by calculating the data using certain techniques.Another family of algorithms that is widely used in recommender systems is collaborative filtering.  One of the most common types of Collaborative Filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by Amazon.com''s recommender system.  User-based collaborative filtering attempts to model the social process of asking a friend for a recommendation. A particular type of collaborative filtering algorithms uses matrix factorization, a low-rank matrix approximation techique{{citation}}. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. The Netflix Prize, a contest with a dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and a grand prize of $1,000,000, has energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms.  The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction:{{cite web}}Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(13,0,'{{two other uses}}\u000a{{Sociology}}A social network is a social structure made of individuals (or organizations) called "nodes," which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige.Social network analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and ties. Nodes are the individual actors within the networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph-based structures are often very complex.  There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes. Research in a number of academic fields has shown that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. In its simplest form, a social network is a map of all of the relevant ties between all the nodes being studied. The network can also be used to measure social capital -- the value that an individual gets from the social network. These concepts are often displayed in a social network diagram, where nodes are the points and ties are the lines.\u000aSocial network analysis\u000aSocial network analysis (related to network theory) has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology.  It has also gained a significant following in anthropology, biology, communication studies, economics, geography, information science, organizational studies, social psychology, and sociolinguistics, and has become a popular topic of speculation and study. People have used the idea of "social network" loosely for over a century to connote complex sets of relationships between members of social systems at all scales, from interpersonal to international. In 1954, J. A. Barnes started using the term systematically to denote patterns of ties, encompassing concepts traditionally used by the public and those used by social scientists: bounded groups (e.g., tribes, families) and social categories (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Scholars such as S.D. Berkowitz, Stephen Borgatti, Ronald Burt, Kathleen Carley, Martin Everett, Katherine Faust, Linton Freeman, Mark Granovetter, David Knoke, David Krackhardt, Peter Marsden, Nicholas Mullins, Anatol Rapoport, Stanley Wasserman, Barry Wellman, Douglas R. White, and Harrison White expanded the use of systematic social network analysis.Linton Freeman, The Development of Social Network Analysis. Vancouver: Empirical Press, 2006.Social network analysis has now moved from being a suggestive metaphor to an analytic approach to a paradigm, with its own theoretical statements, methods, social network analysis software, and researchers. Analysts reason from whole to part; from structure to relation to individual; from behavior to attitude. They typically either study whole networks (also known as complete networks), all of the ties containing specified relations in a defined population, or personal networks (also known as egocentric networks), the ties that specified people have, such as their "personal communities".Wellman, Barry and S.D. Berkowitz, eds., 1988. Social Structures: A Network Approach. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The distinction between whole/complete networks and personal/egocentric networks has depended largely on how analysts were able to gather data. That is, for groups such as companies, schools, or membership societies, the analyst was expected to have complete information about who was in the network, all participants being both potential egos and alters. Personal/egocentric studies were typically conducted when identities of egos were known, but not their alters. These studies rely on the egos to provide information about the identities of alters and there is no expectation that the various egos or sets of alters will be tied to each other. A snowball network refers to the idea that the alters identified in an egocentric survey then become egos themselves and are able in turn to nominate additional alters. While there are severe logistic limits to conducting snowball network studies, a method for examining hybrid networks has recently been developed in which egos in complete networks can nominate alters otherwise not listed who are then available for all subsequent egos to see. Hansen, William B. and Reese, Eric L. 2009. Network Genie User Manual. Greensboro, NC: Tanglewood Research. The hybrid network may be valuable for examining whole/complete networks that are expected to include important players beyond those who are formally identified. For example, employees of a company often work with non-company consultants who may be part of a network that cannot fully be defined prior to data collection. Several analytic tendencies distinguish social network analysis:Freeman, Linton. 2006. The Development of Social Network Analysis. Vancouver: Empirical Pres, 2006; Wellman, Barry and S.D. Berkowitz, eds., 1988. Social Structures: A Network Approach. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\u000a\u000aThere is no assumption that groups are the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from nonlocal communities to links among websites.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRather than treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses on how the structure of ties affects individuals and their relationships.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behavior, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms.\u000a\u000aThe shape of a social network helps determine a network''s usefulness to its individuals. Smaller, tighter networks can be less useful to their members than networks with lots of loose connections (weak ties) to individuals outside the main network. More open networks, with many weak ties and social connections, are more likely to introduce new ideas and opportunities to their members than closed networks with many redundant ties. In other words, a group of friends who only do things with each other already share the same knowledge and opportunities. A group of individuals with connections to other social worlds is likely to have access to a wider range of information. It is better for individual success to have connections to a variety of networks rather than many connections within a single network. Similarly, individuals can exercise influence or act as brokers within their social networks by bridging two networks that are not directly linked (called filling structural holes).Scott, John. 1991. Social Network Analysis. London: Sage.The power of social network analysis stems from its difference from traditional social scientific studies, which assume that it is the attributes of individual actors\u2014whether they are friendly or unfriendly, smart or dumb, etc.\u2014that matter. Social network analysis produces an alternate view, where the attributes of individuals are less important than their relationships and ties with other actors within the network. This approach has turned out to be useful for explaining many real-world phenomena, but leaves less room for individual agency, the ability for individuals to influence their success, because so much of it rests within the structure of their network.Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations. For example, power within organizations often comes more from the degree to which an individual within a network is at the center of many relationships than actual job title. Social networks also play a key role in hiring, in business success, and in job performance. Networks provide ways for companies to gather information, deter competition, and collude in setting prices or policies.Wasserman, Stanley, and Faust, Katherine. 1994. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\u000aHistory of social network analysisA summary of the progress of social networks and social network analysis has been written by Linton Freeman.The Development of Social Network Analysis Vancouver: Empirical Press.Precursors of social networks in the late 1800s include \u00c9mile Durkheim and Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies. T\u00f6nnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (gemeinschaft) or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (gesellschaft). Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors. He distinguished between a traditional society \u2013 "mechanical solidarity" \u2013 which prevails if individual differences are minimized, and the modern society \u2013 "organic solidarity" \u2013 that develops out of cooperation between differentiated individuals with independent roles. Georg Simmel, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, was the first scholar to think directly in social network terms. His essays pointed to the nature of network size on interaction and to the likelihood of interaction in ramified, loosely-knit networks rather than groups (Simmel, 1908/1971). After a hiatus in the first decades of the twentieth century, three main traditions in social networks appeared. In the 1930s, J.L. Moreno pioneered the systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (sociometry), while a Harvard group led by W. Lloyd Warner and Elton Mayo explored interpersonal relations at work. In 1940, A.R. Radcliffe-Brown''s presidential address to British anthropologists urged the systematic study of networks.A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, "On Social Structure," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute: 70 (1940): 1-12. However, it took about 15 years before this call was followed-up systematically. Social network analysis developed with the kinship studies of Elizabeth Bott in England in the 1950s and the 1950s-1960s urbanization studies of the University of Manchester group of anthropologists (centered around Max Gluckman and later J. Clyde Mitchell) investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Concomitantly, British anthropologist S.F. Nadel codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.[Nadel, SF. 1957. The Theory of Social Structure. London: Cohen and West.In the 1960s-1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group was centered around Harrison White and his students at the Harvard University Department of Social Relations: Ivan Chase, Bonnie Erickson, Harriet Friedmann, Mark Granovetter, Nancy Howell, Joel Levine, Nicholas Mullins, John Padgett, Michael Schwartz and Barry Wellman. Also important in this early group were Charles Tilly, who focused on networks in political sociology and social movements, and Stanley Milgram, who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman. http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html Mark Granovetter and Barry Wellman are among the former students of White who have elaborated and popularized social network analysis.Mark Granovetter, "Introduction for the French Reader," Sociologica 2 (2007): 1-8; Wellman, Barry. 1988. "Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance." Pp. 19-61 in Social Structures: A Network Approach, edited by Barry Wellman and S.D. Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.White''s was not the only group. Significant independent work was done by scholars elsewhere: University of California Irvine social scientists interested in mathematical applications, centered around Linton Freeman, including John Boyd, Susan Freeman, Kathryn Faust, A. Kimball Romney and Douglas White; quantitative analysts at the University of Chicago, including Joseph Galaskiewicz, Wendy Griswold, Edward Laumann, Peter Marsden, Martina Morris, and John Padgett; and communication scholars at Michigan State University, including Nan Lin and Everett Rogers. A substantively-oriented University of Toronto sociology group developed in the 1970s, centered on former students of Harrison White: S.D. Berkowitz, Harriet Friedmann, Nancy Leslie Howard, Nancy Howell, Lorne Tepperman and Barry Wellman, and also including noted modeler and game theorist Anatol Rapoport.In terms of theory, it critiqued methodological individualism and group-based analyses, arguing that seeing the world as social networks offered more analytic leverage.Mark Granovetter, "Introduction for the French Reader," Sociologica 2 (2007): 1-8; Wellman, Barry. 1988. "Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance." Pp. 19-61 in Social Structures: A Network Approach, edited by Barry Wellman and S.D. Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (see also Scott, 2000 and Freeman, 2004).\u000aResearchSocial network analysis has been used in epidemiology to help understand how patterns of human contact aid or inhibit the spread of diseases such as HIV in a population. The evolution of social networks can sometimes be modeled by the use of agent based models, providing insight into the interplay between communication rules, rumor spreading and social structure. SNA may also be an effective tool for mass surveillance -- for example the Total Information Awareness program was doing in-depth research on strategies to analyze social networks to determine whether or not U.S. citizens were political threats.Diffusion of innovations theory explores social networks and their role in influencing the spread of new ideas and practices. Change agents and opinion leaders often play major roles in spurring the adoption of innovations, although factors inherent to the innovations also play a role.Robin Dunbar has suggested that the typical size of an egocentric network is constrained to about 150 members due to possible limits in the capacity of the human communication channel. The rule arises from cross-cultural studies in sociology and especially anthropology of the maximum size of a village (in modern parlance most reasonably understood as an ecovillage). It is theorized in evolutionary psychology that the number may be some kind of limit of average human ability to recognize members and track emotional facts about all members of a group. However, it may be due to economics and the need to track "free riders", as it may be easier in larger groups to take advantage of the benefits of living in a community without contributing to those benefits.Mark Granovetter found in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation. Cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties". Guanxi is a central concept in Chinese society (and other East Asian cultures) that can be summarized as the use of personal influence. Guanxi can be studied from a social network approach.Barry Wellman, Wenhong Chen and Dong Weizhen. \u201cNetworking Guanxi." Pp. 221-41 in Social Connections in China: Institutions, Culture and the Changing Nature of Guanxi, edited by Thomas Gold, Douglas Guthrie and David Wank. Cambridge University Press, 2002.The small world phenomenon is the hypothesis that the chain of social acquaintances required to connect one arbitrary person to another arbitrary person anywhere in the world is generally short. The concept gave rise to the famous phrase six degrees of separation after a 1967 small world experiment by psychologist Stanley Milgram. In Milgram''s experiment, a sample of US individuals were asked to reach a particular target person by passing a message along a chain of acquaintances. The average length of successful chains turned out to be about five intermediaries or six separation steps (the majority of chains in that study actually failed to complete). The methods (and ethics as well) of Milgram''s experiment was later questioned by an American scholar, and some further research to replicate Milgram''s findings had found that the degrees of connection needed could be higher.Could It Be A Big World After All?: Judith Kleinfeld article. Academic researchers continue to explore this phenomenon as Internet-based communication technology has supplemented the phone and postal systems available during the times of Milgram. A recent electronic small world experiment at Columbia University found that about five to seven degrees of separation are sufficient for connecting any two people through e-mail.Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, Duncan Watts.Collaboration graphs can be used to illustrate good and bad relationships between humans. A positive edge between two nodes denotes a positive relationship (friendship, alliance, dating) and a negative edge between two nodes denotes a negative relationship (hatred, anger). Signed social network graphs can be used to predict the future evolution of the graph. In signed social networks, there is the concept of "balanced" and "unbalanced" cycles. A balanced cycle is defined as a cycle where the product of all the signs are positive. Balanced graphs represent a group of people who are unlikely to change their opinions of the other people in the group. Unbalanced graphs represent a group of people who are very likely to change their opinions of the people in their group. For example, a group of 3 people (A, B, and C) where A and B have a positive relationship, B and C have a positive relationship, but C and A have a negative relationship is an unbalanced cycle. This group is very likely to morph into a balanced cycle, such as one where B only has a good relationship with A, and both A and B have a negative relationship with C. By using the concept of balances and unbalanced cycles, the evolution of signed social network graphs can be predicted.One study has found that happiness tends to be correlated in social networks. When a person is happy, nearby friends have a 25 percent higher chance of being happy themselves. Furthermore, people at the center of a social network tend to become happier in the future than those at the periphery. Clusters of happy and unhappy people were discerned within the studied networks, with a reach of three degrees of separation: a person''s happiness was associated with the level of happiness of their friends'' friends'' friends.James H. Fowler and Nicholas A. Christakis. 2008. "Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study." British Medical Journal. December 4, 2008: doi:10.1136/bmj.a2338. Media account for those who cannot retrieve the original: Happiness: It Really is Contagious Retrieved December 5, 2008. Some researchers have suggested that human social networks may have a genetic basis.{{cite news}}  Using a sample of twins from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, they found that in-degree (the number of times a person is named as a friend), transitivity (the probability that two friends are friends with one another), and betweenness centrality (the number of paths in the network that pass through a given person) are all significantly heritable.  Existing models of network formation cannot account for this intrinsic node variation, so the researchers propose an alternative "Attract and Introduce" model that can explain heritability and many other features of human social networks.{{cite journal}}\u000aApplication to Environmental IssuesThe 1984 book The IRG Solution argued that central media and government-type hierarchical organizations  could not adequately understand the environmental crisis we were manufacturing, or how to initiate adequate solutions. It argued that the widespread introduction of Information Routing Groups was required to create a social network whose overall intelligence could collectively understand the issues and devise and implement correct workeable solutions and policies.\u000aMetrics (Measures) in social network analysis\u000a\u000aBetweenness\u000aThe extent to which a node lies between other nodes in the network.  This measure takes into account the connectivity of the node&#39;s neighbors, giving a higher value for nodes which bridge clusters. The measure reflects the number of people who a person is connecting indirectly through their direct links.The most comprehensive reference is: Wasserman, Stanley, & Faust, Katherine. (1994).

A centralized network will have many of its links dispersed around one or a few nodes, while a decentralized network is one in which there is little variation between the number of links each node possesses.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCloseness\u000aThe degree an individual is near all other individuals in a network (directly or indirectly). It reflects the ability to access information through the &#34;grapevine&#34; of network members.  Thus, closeness is the inverse of the sum of the shortest distances between each individual and every other person in the network. (See also: Proxemics) The shortest path may also be known as the &#34;geodesic distance&#34;. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aClustering coefficient\u000aA measure of the likelihood that two associates of a node are associates themselves. A higher clustering coefficient indicates a greater &#39;cliquishness&#39;.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCohesion\u000aThe degree to which actors are connected directly to each other by cohesive bonds. Groups are identified as \u2018cliques\u2019 if every individual is directly tied to every other individual, \u2018social circles\u2019 if there is less stringency of direct contact, which is imprecise, or as structurally cohesive blocks if precision is wanted.Cohesive.blocking is the R program for computing structural cohesion according to the Moody-White (2003) algorithm.

It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to nodes having a high score contribute more to the score of the node in question.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLocal Bridge\u000aAn edge is a local bridge if its endpoints share no common neighbors.  Unlike a bridge, a local bridge is contained in a cycle.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPath Length\u000aThe distances between pairs of nodes in the network.

Like other software tools, the data can be saved in external files. Additional information comparing the various data input formats used by network analysis software packages is available at NetWiki. Network analysis tools allow researchers to investigate large networks like the Internet, disease transmission, etc. These tools provide mathematical functions that can be applied to the network model.\u000aVizualization of NetworksVisual representation of social networks is important to understand the network data and convey the result of the analysis http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/articles/volume1/Freeman.html.  Most of the softwares have besides the analytical tools also modules for network visuaization. Exploration of the data is done through displaying nodes and ties in various layouts, and attributing colors, size and other advanced properties to nodes.Typical representation of the network data are graphs in network layout (nodes and ties). These are not very easy-to-read and do not allow an intuitive interpretation.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(15,0,'Body image is a term which may refer to a person''s perception of his or her own physical appearance, or the interpretation of the body by the brain. Essentially, body image describes how one perceives one''s appearance to be in relation to others, which in many cases may be dramatically different from one''s objective physical condition or how one is actually perceived by others. A 2007 report by the American Psychological Association found that a culture-wide sexualizationhttp://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf   Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls, American Psychological Association, 2007. of girls (and women)http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf   Report of the APA Task Force on the Sex of Girls, American Psychological Association, 2007. was contributing to increased female anxiety associated with body image.http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf   Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls, American Psychological Association, 2007. Similar findings associated with body image were found by an Australian government Senate Standing Committee report on the sexualization of children in the media.http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/committee/eca_ctte/sexualisation_of_children/report/index.htmhttp://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/committee/eca_ctte/sexualisation_of_children/report/report.pdfStudy finds that women are more worried about their body image than men. http://www.bolohealth.com/news/2826-women-more-worried-about-their-body-image-than-men\u000aHistoryFrom the point of view of psychoanalysis, the French child psychoanalyst Francoise Dolto has developed a theory concerning the unconscious body image.Francoise Dolto, L''image inconscient du corps. Paris: Seuil, 1984. Negative feelings towards a fat person''s body can in some cases lead to mental disorders such as depression or eating disorders such as Bulimia nervosa, though there can be a variety of different reasons why these disorders can occur.Within the media industry there have recently been popular debates focusing on how Size Zero models can negatively influence young people into feeling insecure about their own body image. It has been suggested that size zero models be banned from cat walks. Many celebrities are targeted by the media due to their often drastic weight loss and slender frames, examples of such personalities would be Victoria Beckham, Nicole Richie and British Super Model Kate Moss. Some examples of celebrity men targeted in a similar fashion can be found, but the media seem to focus principally on the effect that the Size Zero phenomenon has on young women. Media however, is generally quick to denounce celebrities endorsing fad diets, including popstars who describe girls who are not under a peer pressurized size, a "social suicide".Online audition website peaks trafficBody image is often measured by asking the subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the amount of body dissatisfaction. \u000aMonteath and McCabe found that 44%The influence of societal factors on female body image. J Soc Psychol. 1997 Dec;137(6):708-27 of women express negative feelings about both individual body parts and their bodies as a whole. Body image is how you see yourself when you look in the mirror or when you picture yourself in your\u000amind, what you believe about your own appearance, how you feel about your body, including your height, shape, and weight.Psychology Today found that 56% of the women and about 40% of the men who responded to their survey in 1997 were dissatisfied with their overall appearance.Psychology Today: Body Image Poll Results The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, and more women than men desire to lose weight. Kashubeck-West et al. reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear.Separating the effects of sex and weight-loss desire on body satisfactionMen''s body image is a topic of increasing interest in both academic articles and in the popular press. Current research indicates many men wish to become more muscular than they currently perceive themselves to be, often desiring up to 26 pounds of additional muscle mass. Acording to the study western men overestimate muscle mass then that of asian men by as much as 30 pounds.Pope, H.G., Phillips, K.A., & Olivardia, R. (2000). The Adonis complex: The secret crisis of male body obsession. Sydney: The Free Press.The desire for additional muscle has been linked to many men''s concepts about masculinity. A variety of research has indicated a relationship between men''s endorsement of traditionally masculine ideas and characteristics, and his desire for additional muscleMcCreary, Saucier, &Courtenay 2005; Kimmel & Mahalik, 2004. Some research has suggested this relationship between muscle and masculinity may begin early in life, as boys'' action figures are often depicted as super-muscular, often beyond the actual limits of human physiology.Pope, et al. 1999{{specify}}\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aBeauty\u000aBody shape\u000aNaturism\u000aPhysical attractiveness\u000aSelf image\u000aSelf (psychology)\u000aSex in advertising\u000aSexual objectification\u000aFeminist perspectives on eating disorders\u000a\u000a\u000aFootnotes{{reflist}}\u000aSources\u000a\u000aBlakeslee, S.

Some of this developmental risk as in the case of placental infarction, maternal anemia and cardiac problems may cause intrauterine hypoxia, umbilical cord occlusion or cord prolapse may cause ischemia, resulting in cerebral injury, the prefrontal cortex in the fetus and neonate is highly susceptible to damage as a result of oxygen deprivation which has been shown to contribute to executive dysfunction, ADHD, and may affect personality traits associated with both eating disorders and comorbid disorders such as impulsivity, mental rigidity and obsessionality. The problem of perinatal brain injury, in terms of the costs to society and to the affected individuals and their families, is extraordinary.

Maladaptive levels of certain traits may be acquired as a result of anoxic or traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson''s disease, neurotoxicity such as lead exposure, bacterial infection such as Lyme disease or viral infection such as Toxoplasma gondii as well as hormonal influences.

Children who are subjugated to abuse may develop a disordered eating pattern in an effort to gain some sense of control or for a sense of comfort. Or they may be in an environment where the diet is unhealthy or insufficient. Child abuse and neglect can cause profound changes in both the physiological structure and the neurochemistry of the developing brain. Children who, as wards of the state, were placed in orphanages or foster homes are especially susceptible to developing a disordered eating pattern. In a study done in New Zealand 25% of the study subjects in foster care exhibited an eating disorder (Tarren-Sweeney M. 2006). An unstable home environment is detrimental to the emotional well-being of children, even in the absence of blatant abuse or neglect the stress of an unstable home can contribute to the development of an eating disorder.Horish N et al.

Those that are socially isolated have a higher mortality rate in general as compared to individuals that have established social relationships. This effect on mortality is markedly increased in those with pre-existing medical or psychiatric conditions, and has been especially noted in cases of coronary heart disease. "The magnitude of risk associated with social isolation is comparable with that of cigarette smoking and other major biomedical and psychosocial risk factors." (Brummett et al.)Social isolation can be inherently stressful, depressing and anxiety provoking. In an attempt to ameliorate these distressful feelings an individual may engage in emotional eating in which food serves as a source of comfort. The loneliness of social isolation and the inherent stressors thus associated have been implicated as triggering factors in binge eating as well.Troop NA, Bifulco A.

PMID 3866486\u000aParental influence\u000aParental influence has been shown to be an intrinsic component in developing the eating behaviors of children. This influence is manifested and shaped by a variety of diverse factors such as familial genetic predisposition, dietary choices as dictated by cultural or ethnic preferences, the parents'' own body shape and eating patterns, the degree of involvement and expectations of their children''s eating behavior as well as the interpersonal relationship of parent and child. This is in addition to the general psychosocial climate of the home and the presence or absence of a nurturing stable environment. It has been shown that maladaptive parental behavior has an important role in the development of eating disorders. As to the more subtle aspects of parental influence it has been shown that eating patterns are established in early childhood and that children should be allowed to decide when their appetite is satisfied as early as the age of two. A direct link has been proven between obesity and parental pressure to eat more.Coercive tactics in regard to diet have not been proven to be efficacious in controlling a child''s eating behavior. Affection and attention have been shown to affect the degree of a childs'' finickiness and their acceptance of a more varied diet.Johnson JG, et al.

PMID 17341215\u000aPeer pressure\u000aIn various studies such as one conducted by The McKnight Investigators, peer pressure was shown to be a significant contributor to body image concerns and attitudes toward eating among subjects in their teens and early twenties.Eleanor Mackey and co-author, Annette M. La Greca of the University of Miami, studied 236 teen girls from public high schools in southeast Florida. "Teen girls'' concerns about their own weight, about how they appear to others and their perceptions that their peers want them to be thin are significantly related to weight-control behavior," says psychologist Eleanor Mackey of the Children''s National Medical Center in Washington and lead author of the study. "Those are really important."According to one study, 40% of 9- and 10-year-old girls are already trying to lose weight.Schreiber GB et.al. Weight modification efforts reported by black and white preadolescent girls: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study. Pediatrics. 1996 Jul;98(1):63\u201370. PMID 8668414 Such dieting is reported to being influenced by peer behavior, with many of those individuals on a diet reporting that their friends also were dieting. The number of friends dieting and the number of friends who pressured them to diet also played a significant role in their own choices.Page RM, Suwanteerangkul J.Dieting among Thai adolescents: having friends who diet and pressure to diet.

PMID 15626514\u000aIn men\u000aIt is estimated that 8 million people in the United States are suffering from an Eating Disorder, and of that number 10% are men. Professionals suggest that the percentage suffering that are men is much higher, but because of the old fashioned idea that this illness strikes only women, few men come forward to find the help they deserve. To date, the evidence suggests that the gender bias of clinicians means that diagnosing either bulimia or anorexia in men is less likely despite identical behavior. Men are more likely to be diagnosed as suffering depression with associated appetite changes than receive a primary diagnosis of an eating disorder.In addition, there may often be shrouds of secrecy because of the lack of therapy groups and treatment centers offering groups specifically designed for men. They may feel very alone at the thought of having to sit in a group of women, to be part of a program designed for women, and even at the prospect that a treatment facility will turn them down because of their sex.Men who participate in low-weight oriented sports such as jockeys, wrestlers and runners are at an increased risk of developing an Eating Disorder such as Anorexia or Bulimia. The pressure to succeed, to be the best, to be competitive and to win at all costs, combined with any non-athletic pressures in their lives (relationship issues, family problems, abuse, etc.) can help to contribute the onset of their disordered eating.It is not uncommon for men suffering with an Eating Disorder to also suffer with alcohol abuse and/or substance abuse simultaneously (though many women also suffer both disordered eating and substance abuse problems, combined). This may be due to the addictive nature of their psychological health, combined with the strong images put out by society of men''s overindulgence in alcohol. There may also be a link between ADHD, with male sufferers of Anorexia, Bulimia, and self-injury. More research is still needing to be done in this area. For all those who suffer, men and women alike, there are many possible co-existing psychological illnesses that can be present, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, self-injury behaviors, substance abuse, OCD, borderline personality disorder, and Multiple Personality Disorders.It is important to remember is that most of the underlying psychological factors that lead to an Eating Disorder are the same for both men and women; low self-esteem, a need to be accepted, depression, anxiety, an inability to cope with emotions & personal issues, and other existing psychological illnesses. All of the physical dangers and complications associated with being the sufferer of an Eating Disorder are the same. A great number of the causes are the same or very similar (family problems, relationship issues, alcoholic/addictive parent, abuse, societal pressure). Most of all, it is important to remember that all people with eating disorders deserve to find recovery, happiness, and self-love on the other side.\u000aSymptoms-complications\u000aSymptoms and complications vary according to the nature and severity of the eating disorder:Strumia R.Dermatologic signs in patients with eating disorders..Am J Clin Dermatol. 2005;6(3):165-73.

All organic causes should be ruled out prior to a diagnosis of an eating disorder or any other psychiatric disorder is made.\u000aMedical\u000aThe diagnostic workup typically includes complete medical and psychosocial history and follows a rational and formulaic approach to the diagnosis. Neuroimaging using fMRI, MRI, PET and SPECT scans have been used to detect cases in which a lesion, tumor or other organic condition has been either the sole causative or contributory factor in an eating disorder. "Right frontal intracerebral lesions with their close relationship to the limbic system could be causative for eating disorders, we therefore recommend performing a cranial MRI in all patients with suspected eating disorders" (Trummer M et al. 2002), "intracranial pathology should also be considered however certain is the diagnosis of early-onset anorexia nervosa. Second, neuroimaging plays an important part in diagnosing early-onset anorexia nervosa, both from a clinical and a research prospective".(O''Brien et al. 2001).Trummer M, Eustacchio S, Unger F, Tillich M, Flaschka G Right hemispheric frontal lesions as a cause for anorexia nervosa report of three cases.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(17,0,'\u000a"Sex object" redirects here. For other uses, see Sex object (disambiguation)\u000aSexual objectification refers to the practice of regarding or treating another person merely as an instrument (object) towards the person''s sexual pleasure. Objectification is an attitude that regards a person as a commodity or as an object for use, with insufficient regard for a person''s personality.LeMoncheck, Linda, Loose Women, Lecherous Men: A Feminist Philosophy of Sex (Oxford University press, 1997), ISBN 9780195105559, p. 133 Objectification is most commonly examined at a societal level, but can also arise at an individual level. The concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of women, is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism.Barry, Kathleen, Female Sexual Slavery (NYU Press, 1994), ISBN 9780814710697, p.247Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts, ''The Beast within the Beauty: An Existential Perspective on the Objectification and Condemnation of Women'' in Jeff Greenberg, Sander Leon Koole, Thomas A. Pyszczynski and Tom Pyszczynski (eds) Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychology (Guilford Press, 2004), ISBN 9781593850409Many feminists regard sexual objectification as objectionable and as playing an important role in the inequality of the sexes.Bartky, Sandra Lee, Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression (Routledge, 1990), ISBN 0-415-90186-3, p. 26 Some social commentators, however, argue that some modern women objectify themselves as an expression of their empowerment over men, while others argue that increased sexual freedom has led to an increase of the objectification of men.Study: For Israeli women, going on vacation means more sex Irit Rosenblum, Haaretz, 26/02/2008.Botting, Kate and Botting, Douglas. "Men Can Be Sex Objects Too". Cosmopolitan. August 1996.No more faking: "Sex isn''t over until we''ve had an orgasm...," say Melinda Gallagher and Emily Kramer, founders of the outrageous Cake sex empire for women. But is their love of porn and lapdancing breaking new ground, or is so-called ''raunch feminism'' setting the cause back?\u000aSharon Krum The Guardian, Monday May 15, 2006.Speedophobia by  Mark Simpson, Out Magazine  The idea of sexual objectification has also been an important area of discussion and debate in the area of sexual ethics and the philosophy of sex.See, for example \u2013 Soble, Alan (ed). 1997. Sex, Love and Friendship: Studies of the Society for the Philosophy of Sex and Love 1977\u20131992. Amsterdam: Rodopi. ISBN 9042002271. Chapters 13\u201316.\u000aSexual objectification of womenFeminist scholars say that the objectification of women involves the act of disregarding the personal and intellectual abilities and capabilities of a female; and reducing a woman''s worth or role in society to that of an instrument for the sexual pleasure that she can produce in the mind of another.  Although opinions differ as to which situations are objectionable, some feminists see objectification of women taking place in the sexually oriented depictions of women in advertising and media, women being portrayed as weak or submissive through pornography, images in more mainstream media such as advertising and art, stripping and prostitution, men brazenly evaluating or judging women sexually or aesthetically in public spaces, and the presumed need for cosmetic surgery, particularly breast enlargement and labiaplasty.{{Citation needed}}Feminists argue that women have historically been valued mainly for their physical attributes. Some feminists and psychologists argue that such objectification can lead to negative psychological effects including depression and hopelessness, and can give women negative self-images because of the belief that their intelligence and competence are currently not being, or will never be, acknowledged by society.{{cite book}}{{cite journal}} The precise degree to how objectification has affected women and society in general is a topic of academic debate. Such claims include: girls'' understanding of the importance of appearance in society may contribute to feelings of fear, shame, and disgust that some experience during the transition from girlhood to womanhood because they sense that they are becoming more visible to society as sexual objects;Lee, Janet. 1994. Menarche and the (hetero)sexualization of the female body. Gender & Society 8(3):343\u2013362. {{DOI}} and that young women are especially susceptible to objectification, as they are often taught that power, respect, and wealth can be derived from one''s outward appearance.{{cite web}}Pro-feminist cultural critics such as Robert Jensen and Sut Jhally accuse mass media and advertising of promoting the objectification of women to help promote goods and services.Jensen, Robert, ''Using Pornography'' in Dines, Gail, Robert Jensen and Ann Russo (eds) Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality (Routledge, 1998), ISBN 9780415918138Jhally, Sut (dir) Dreamworlds II: Desire, Sex, Power in Music (Media Education Foundation, USA, 1997)Frith, Katherine, Ping Shaw and Hong Cheng ''The Construction of Beauty: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of Women''s Magazine Advertising'' in Journal of Communication 55 (1), 2005, pp.56\u201370\u000aFemale self-objectificationFeminists such as Ariel Levy contend that Western women have begun to sexually objectify themselves by choice, by wearing increasingly revealing clothing and engaging in lewd behavior. While some women see such behaviour as a form of empowerment, critics contend that it has led to greater emphasis on a physical criterion for women''s perceived self worth.''Save the males'': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses, By KATHLEEN PARKER, NY Daily News, June 30th 2008. Based on "Save the Males" by Kathleen Parker, Copyright  2008, Random House, an imprint of Random House Publishing Group.Levy discusses this phenomenon in her 2005 book Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture. Levy followed the camera crew from the Girls Gone Wild video series, and argues that contemporary America''s sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves.{{cite news}} In today''s culture, Levy writes, the idea of a woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit pornography has become a symbol of feminist strength; she says that she was surprised at how many people, both men and women, working for programs such as Girls Gone Wild told her that this new "raunchy" culture marked not the downfall of feminism but its triumph, because it proved that U.S. women have become strong enough to express their sexuality publicly.\u000aSexual objectification of men\u000aFeminist authors Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf write that women''s sexual liberation has led many women to view men as sex objects.Sommers, Christina Hoff. 1994.

Gay male pornography makes up 1/3 of the adult film industry.{{Citation needed}} Some male strip clubs cater to a gay male clientele.\u000aViews on sexual objectification{{related}}\u000aWhile the concept of sexual objectification is important within feminist and masculist theory, ideas vary widely on what constitutes sexual objectification and what are the ethical implications of such objectification. Some feminists such as Naomi Wolf find the concept of physical attractiveness itself to be problematic,Wolf, Naomi. (1992). The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women. New York: William Morrow and Co. (Reprinted, 2002. New York: Harper Perennial) ISBN 0060512180 with some radical feminists being opposed to any evaluation of another person''s sexual attractiveness based on physical characteristics. John Stoltenberg goes so far as to condemn as wrongfully objectifying any sexual fantasy that involves visualization of a woman.Stoltenberg, John. 1989. Refusing to be a man: Essays on sex and justice. Portland, OR: Breitenbush Books. (Reprinted, 2000. Oxford: Routledge) ISBN 1841420417Radical feminists view objectification as playing a central role in reducing women to what they refer to as the "sex class". While some feminists view mass media in societies that they argue are patriarchal to be objectifying, they often focus on pornography as playing an egregious role in habituating men to objectify women.{{Citation needed}}  Other feminists, particularly those identified with sex-positive feminism, take a different view of sexual objectification and see it as a problem when it is not counterbalanced by women''s sense of their own sexual subjectivity.{{Citation needed}}Some social conservatives have taken up aspects of the feminist critique of sexual objectification. In their view however, the increase in the sexual objectification of both genders in Western culture is one of the negative legacies of the sexual revolution.Shalit, Wendy. 1999.

Modesty revisited. Boundless webzine.Other feminists contest feminist claims about the objectification of women. Camille Paglia holds that "Turning people into sex objects is one of the specialties of our species." In her view, objectification is closely tied to (and may even be identical with) the highest human faculties toward conceptualization and aesthetics.{{cite book}} Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy holds that the label "sex object" means nothing because inanimate objects are not sexual. She continues that women are their bodies as well as their minds and souls.McElroy, Wendy. 2006. A feminist overview of pornography, ending in a defense thereof.

These observations can take place in the media or through personal experienceBartky, Sandra Lee. (1990). Femininity and Domination: Studies in the Phenomenology of Oppression. Routledge.

Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. Objectification theory is essential in feminist theory,{{POV-statement}} as the sexual objectification and self objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.Goldenberg, Jamie L., and Tomi-Ann Roberts.

ISBN 9781593850409.\u000aSelf objectification\u000aSelf-objectification allows individuals to acclimate to a society where the objectification of female bodies is prevalent. Self objectification can increase in elicit situations which heightens the awareness of an individual\u2019s physical appearanceFredrickson, Barbara L. and Kristen Harrison. (2005). Throwing like a girl: Self-objectification predicts adolescent girl''s motor performance. Journal of Sport and Social Issues 29(1):79\u2013101. {{DOI}}. p 82.. Here, the presence of a third person observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are looking at them, or will be looking at them, they are more likely to care about their physical appearance. Examples of enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.\u000aWomen, girls, and self-objectification\u000aPrimarily, objectification theory describes how women and girls are influenced as a result of expected social and gender roles. Research indicates not all women are influenced equally, due to the anatomical, hormonal, and genetic differences of the female body; however, women\u2019s bodies are often objectified and evaluated more frequently.Fredrickson and Harrison (2005), p 90\u201395. Females learn that their physical appearance is important to themselves and society. As a result, females consider their physical appearance often, expecting that others will also.Sexual objectification occurs when a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body. The purpose of this recognition is to bring enjoyment to others, or to serve as a sexual object for societyLeMoncheck, Linda. (1997). Loose Women, Lecherous Men: A Feminist Philosophy of Sex (Oxford University Press). ISBN 9780195105559. p 133.. Sexual objectification can occur as a social construct among individuals.\u000aPsychological consequences\u000aResearch indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal levelFredrickson, Barbara L.; Tomi-Ann Roberts. (1997). "Objectification Theory: Toward understanding women''s lived experiences and mental health risks". Psychology of Women Quarterly 21(2):173\u2013206. {{doi}}. Retrieved on 2009-4-11.. These include increased self consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.\u000aSexual fetishism\u000aSexual fetishism may involve sexual objectification, when a person is assigned or adopts the status of a fetish object. This may provide erotic humiliation for the person treated in such manner. As with most BDSM-related activities, it is not considered abusive when engaged in consensually. Allen Jones'' "Hat Stand and Table Sculpture", which show semi-naked women in the roles of furniture, are clear examples of the depiction of the fantasy of sexual objectification.\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aCommodification\u000aLookism\u000aObjectification\u000aObjectification theory\u000aSex in advertising\u000aSexuality in music videos\u000aSexualization\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading\u000a\u000aBartky, Sandra Lee. 1990.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(18,0,'{{sprotected2}}\u000a{{DiseaseDisorder infobox}}\u000aChildhood obesity  is a condition where excess body fat negatively affects a child''s health or wellbeing.  As methods to determine body fat directly are difficult, the diagnosis of obesity is often based on BMI. Due to the rising prevalence of obesity in children and its many adverse health effects it is being recognized as a serious public health concern.  The term overweight rather than obese is often used in children as it is less stigmatizing.{{cite journal}}\u000aClassification\u000a\u000a \u000a Body mass index (BMI) is acceptable for determining obesity for children two years of age and older.{{cite journal}}  The normal range for BMI in children vary with age and sex.  The Center for Disease Control defines obesity as a BMI greater than the 95th percentile.  It has published tables for determining this in children.{{cite web}}\u000aEffects on healthThe first problems to occur in obese children are usually emotional or psychological.{{cite book}} Childhood obesity however can also lead to life-threatening conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep problems, cancer, and other disorders.http://edition.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/09/13/child.obesity.ap/index.html{{Dead link}}Childhood Obesity Some of the other disorders would include liver disease, early puberty or menarche, eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, skin infections, and asthma and other respiratory problems.Childhood obesity: Complications - MayoClinic.com Studies have shown that overweight children are more likely to grow up to be overweight adults.  Obesity during adolescence has been found to increase mortality rates during adulthood.{{cite journal}}Obese children often suffer from teasing by their peers.{{cite journal}}Obesity.Org Some are harassed or discriminated against by their own family.

A three year randomized controlled study of 1,704 3rd grade children which provided two healthy meals a day in combination with an exercise program and dietary counsellings failed to show a significant reduction in percentage body fat when compared to a control group.  This was partly due to the fact the even though the children believed they were eating less their actual calorie consumption did not decrease with the intervention.  At the same time observed energy expenditure remained similar between the groups.  This occurred even though dietary fat intake decreased from 34% to 27%.{{cite journal}}  A second study of 5,106 children showed similar results.  Even though the children eat an improved diet there was no effect found on BMI.{{cite journal}}  Why these studies did not bring about the desired effect of curbing childhood obesity has been attributed to the interventions not being sufficient enough.  Changes were made primarily in the school environment while it is felt that they must occur in the home, the community, and the school simultaneously to have a significant effect.{{cite book}}Calorie-rich drinks and foods are readily available to children.  Sugar-laden Soft drink consumption may contribute to childhood obesity. In a study of 548 children over a 19 month period the likelihood of obesity increased by 1.6 for every additional soft drink consumed per day.{{cite journal}}Calorie-dense, prepared snacks are available in many locations frequented by children.  As childhood obesity has become more prevalent, snack vending machines in school settings have been reduced by law in a small number of localities.  Eating at fast food restaurants is very common among young people with 75% of 7th to 12th grade students consuming fast food in a given week.{{cite journal}}  Some literature has found a relationship between fat food consumption and obesity.{{cite journal}}  Including a study which found that fast food restaurants near schools increases the risk of obesity among the student population.{{cite journal}}Whole milk consumption verses 2% milk consumption in children of one to two years of age had no effect on weight, height, or body fat percentage.  Therefore, whole milk continues to be recommended for this age group.  However the trend of substituting sweetened drink for milk has been found to lead to excess weight gain.{{cite journal}}\u000aSedentary lifestylePhysical inactivity of children has also shown to be a serious cause, and children who fail to engage in regular physical activity are at greater risk of obesity. Researchers studied the physical activity of 133 children over a three week period using an accelerometer to measure each child''s level of physical activity. They discovered the obese children were 35% less active on school days and 65% less active on weekends compared to non-obese children.Physical inactivity as a child could result in physical inactivity as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, researchers discovered that 25% of those who were considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults.{{cite journal}} Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14 day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75\u201385% excess energy being stored as body fat and fat overfeeding produced 90\u201395% storage of excess energy as body fat.{{cite journal}}Many children fail to exercise because they are spending time doing stationary activities such as computer usage, playing video games or watching television. TV and other technology may be large factors of physically inactive children. Researchers provided a technology questionnaire to 4,561 children, ages 14, 16, and 18. They discovered  children were 21.5% more likely to be overweight when watching 4+ hours of TV per day, 4.5% more likely to be overweight when using a computer one or more hours per day, and unaffected by potential weight gain from playing video games. A randomized trial showed that reducing TV viewing and computer use can decrease age-adjusted BMI; reduced calorie intake was thought to be the greatest contributor to the BMI decrease.{{cite journal}}Technological activities are not the only household influences of childhood obesity. Low-income households can affect a child''s tendency to gain weight. Over a three week period researchers studied the relationship of socioeconomic status (SES) to body composition in 194 children, ages 11\u201312. They measured weight, waist girth, stretch stature, skinfolds, physical activity, TV viewing, and SES; researchers discovered clear SES inclines to upper class children compared to the lower class children.{{cite journal}}\u000aGeneticsChildhood obesity is often the result of an interplay between many genetic and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism predispose individuals to obesity when sufficient calories are present. As such obesity is a major feature of a number of rare genetic conditions that often present in childhood.  \u000a\u000aPrader-Willi syndrome with an incidence between 1 in 12,000 and 1 in 15,000 live births is characterized by hyperphagia and food preoccupations which leads to rapid weight gain in those affected.\u000aBardet-Biedl syndrome\u000aMOMO syndrome\u000aLeptin receptor mutations\u000aCongenital leptin deficiency\u000aMelanocortin receptor mutations\u000a\u000aIn children with early-onset severe obesity (defined by an onset before ten years of age and body mass index over three standard deviations above normal), 7% harbor a single locus mutation.{{cite journal}}  One study found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were obese in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight.{{cite book}}  The percentage of obesity that can be attributed to genetics varies from 6% to 85% depending on the population examined.{{cite journal}}\u000aHome environmentChildren''s food choices are also influenced by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11\u201321, and discovered that four out of five parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods.{{cite journal}} The results of a survey in the UK published in 2010 imply that children raised by their grandparents are more likely to be obese as adults than those raised by their parents.{{cite news}}\u000aDevelopmental factorsVarious developmental factors may affects rates of obesity. Breast-feeding for example may protect against obesity in later life with the duration of breast-feeding inversely associated with the risk of being overweight later on.{{cite web}} A child''s body growth pattern may influence the tendency to gain weight. Researchers measured the standard deviation (SD [weight and length]) scores in a cohort study of 848 babies. They found that infants who had an SD score above 0.67 had catch up growth (they were less likely to be overweight) compared to infants who had less than a 0.67 SD score (they were more likely to gain weight).{{cite journal}}A child''s weight may be influenced when he/she is only an infant. Researchers did a cohort study on 19,397 babies, from their birth until age seven and discovered that fat babies at four months were 1.38 times more likely to be overweight at seven years old compared to normal weight babies. Fat babies at the age of one were 1.17 times more likely to be overweight at age seven compared to normal weight babies.{{cite journal}}\u000aMedical illness\u000aCushing''s syndrome (a condition in which the body contains excess amounts of cortisol) may also influence childhood obesity. Researchers analyzed two isoforms (proteins that have the same purpose as other proteins, but are programmed by different genes) in the cells of 16 adults undergoing abdominal surgery. They discovered that one type of isoform created oxo-reductase activity (the alteration of cortisone to cortisol) and this activity increased 127.5 pmol mg sup when the other type of isoform was treated with cortisol and insulin. The activity of the cortisol and insulin can possibly activate Cushing''s syndrome.{{cite journal}}Hypothyroidism is a hormonal cause of obesity, but it does not significantly affect obese people who have it more than obese people who do not have it. In a comparison of 108 obese patients with hypothyroidism to 131 obese patients without hypothyroidism, researchers discovered that those with hypothyroidism had only 0.077 points more on the caloric intake scale than did those without hypothyroidism.{{cite journal}}\u000aPsychological factorsResearchers surveyed 1,520 children, ages 9\u201310, with a four year follow up and discovered a positive correlation between obesity and low self esteem in the four year follow up. They also discovered that decreased self esteem led to 19% of obese children feeling sad, 48% of them feeling bored, and 21% of them feeling nervous. In comparison, 8% of normal weight children felt sad, 42% of them felt bored, and 12% of them felt nervous.{{cite journal}} Stress can influence a child''s eating habits. Researchers tested the stress inventory of 28 college females and discovered that those who were binge eating had a mean of 29.65 points on the perceived stress scale, compared to the control group who had a mean of 15.19 points.{{cite journal}} |DUPLICATE DATA: doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199707)22:1<89::AID-EAT12>3.0.CO;2-D}} This evidence may demonstrate a link between eating and stress.Feelings of depression can cause a child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered that there was not a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression. Of all the obese adolescents, 8.2% had said to be depressed, compared to 8.9% of the non-obese adolescents who said they were depressed.{{cite journal}} Antidepressants, however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of those with low depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.{{cite journal}}\u000aManagement\u000aLifestyleExclusive breast-feeding is recommended in all newborn infants for its nutritional and other beneficial effects. It may also protect against obesity in later life.\u000aMedicationsThere are no medications currently approved for the treatment of obesity in children. Orlistat and sibutramine may however be helpful in managing moderate obesity in adolescence.  Sibutramine is approved for adolescents older than 16.  It works by altering the brain''s chemistry and decreasing appetite. Orlistat is approved for adolescents older than 12.  It works by preventing the absorption of fat in the intestines.Childhood obesity: Treatments and drugs - MayoClinic.com\u000aEpidemiology\u000aRates of childhood obesity have increased greatly between 1980 and 2010.{{cite web}} Currently 10% of children worldwide are either overweight or obese.\u000aCanada\u000aThe rate of overweight and obesity among Canadian children has increased dramatically in recent years.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(19,0,'Identity politics refers to political arguments that focus upon the self interest and perspectives of social minorities, or self-identified social interest groups. Not all members of any given group are necessarily involved in identity politics.To participate in identity politics, a group may, or may not be marginalized class of people. However, group advocates will often have a self-belief, a self schema or explanatory narrative, that they are in fact a marginalized group. Typically, these group identities are defined in terms of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic or neurological wiring{{Citation needed}}.Minority influence is a central component of identity politics. Minority influence is a form of social influence, which takes place when a majority is being influenced to accept the beliefs or behavior of a minority. Unlike other forms of influence this usually involves a personal shift in private opinion. This personal shift in opinion is called conversion. This type of influence is most likely to take place if the minority is consistent, flexible and appealing to the majority.\u000aUse of the termThe term identity politics has been used in political and academic discourse in the United States since the 1970s{{Citation needed}}. One aim of identity politics has been to empower the oppressed to articulate their oppression in terms of their own experience\u2014a process of consciousness-raising that distinguishes identity politics from the liberal conception of politics as driven by individual self-interest.Identity politics is a phenomenon that arose first at the radical margins of liberal democratic societies in which human rights are recognized, and the term is not usually used to refer to dissident movements within single-party or authoritarian states.Identity politics were first described briefly in an article by L. A. Kauffman, who traced its origins to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), an organization of the civil-rights movement in the early and mid-1960s.L. A. Kauffman, "The Anti-Politics of Identity," Socialist Review (Oakland, Calif.) 20, no. 1 (January-March 1990), 67\u201380. Although SNCC invented many of the fundamental practices, and various black power groups extended them, they apparently found no need to apply a term. Rather, the term emerged when others outside the black freedom movements\u2014particularly, the race- and ethnic-specific women''s liberation movements, such as Black feminism\u2014 began to adopt the practice in the late 1960s.Perhaps the oldest written example of it can be found in the Combahee River Collective Statement of April 1977, subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies,See, e.g., Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism, ed. Zillah R. Eisenstein (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978) and Barbara Smith and the Combahee River Collective have been credited with coining the term; which they defined as "a politics that grew out of our objective material experiences as Black women.Harris, Duchess. From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective: Black Feminist Organizing, 1960-1980, in Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement, eds: Bettye Collier-Thomas, V. P. Franklin, NYU Press, 2001, ISBN 0814716032, p300Some groups have combined identity politics and Marxist social class analysis and class consciousness\u2014the most notable example being the Black Panther Party\u2014but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is MOVE, who mixed black nationalism with anarcho-primitivism (a radical form of green politics based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating a return to hunter gatherer society) and the related idea neo-luddism.\u000aDebates and criticism\u000aNature of the movementThe term identity politics has been applied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. discussed identity politics extensively in his book The Disuniting of America.  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of civil rights, argues that a liberal democracy requires a common basis for culture and society to function.In his view, basing politics on group marginalization fractures the civil polity, and therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization.  Schlesinger believes that movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than, in his view, perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference.\u000aLGBT issues{{See also}}\u000aSome LGBT rights activists, in particular, criticize the identity politics approach to gay rights, particularly the approach based around the terms and concepts of queer theory. Other theorists, drawing on the work of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, describe some forms of identity politics as strategic essentialism that works with hegemonic discourses to achieve collective goals.Liberal-reformist gay and lesbian activists work for full acceptance of gays and lesbians in the institutions and culture of mainstream society, but queer activists instead make a point of declaring themselves outside of the mainstream and having no desire to be accepted by or join it.  The former criticize the latter''s approach as counterproductive and as perpetuating discrimination and societal attitudes against LGBT people, while the latter counter that the former seek to subsume LGBT identities in order to capitalize upon other forms of (racial, economic, geographical) privilege.Ndegayforum.org 27067Nndegayforum.org 27052\u000aHomogeneity and essentialismOthers counter that the intolerant homogeneity of mainstream culture is precisely the fact that makes full acceptance impossible, and that social justice movements should aim not toward integration but rather multicultural pluralism, without recourse to the types of oppressive homogeneity now at play. (See the work of Urvashi Vaid for a discussion of the perils of homogeneity.)Other critics of identity politics claim that it tends toward essentialism, arguing that some of its proponents assume or imply that gender, race, or other group characteristics are fixed or biologically determined traits (or, in the case of gay liberation, based on the Freudian idea that we''re all driven by our sexuality), rather than social constructions. Such criticism is most common with regard to groups based on claims of gender or sexual orientation, where the nature of the defining trait is in dispute.\u000aShared identityStill other critics have argued that groups based on shared identity, other than class (e.g.: religious identity or neurological wiring), can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, such as class conflict in capitalist societies. Even those who support gay rights, fat acceptance or freedom of religion, for instance, may consider these side issues at best.Such arguments have been expressed by a number of writers, such as Eric Hobsbawm,Amielandmelburn.org.uk articles Todd Gitlin,PBS.org, Thinktank transcript 235 Michael Tomasky, Richard Rorty, Sean Wilentz, Robert W. McChesney, Bart Landry, and Jim Sleeper.Ppionline.org Hobsbawm, in particular, has criticized nationalisms, and the principle of national self-determination adopted internationally after World War I, since national governments are often merely an expression of a ruling class or power, and their proliferation was a source of the wars of the twentieth century. Hence Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as the autism rights movement, queer nationalism, Islamism, Cornish nationalism or Ulster Loyalism are just other versions of bourgeois nationalism.\u000aOther criticisms\u000aPost-structruralists argue thate there are no identities, just superficial differences.\u000aExamples of identity politics{{Col-begin}}\u000a{{Col-3}}\u000a\u000aAdultism\u000aAfrocentrism\u000aAmerican Indian Movement\u000aArab nationalism (Pan-Arabism)\u000aAnarcho-punk\u000aAsian American Movement\u000aAutism rights movement\u000aBlack nationalism (pan-Africanism)\u000aBlack power\u000aBumiputera (Malaysia)\u000aChicano nationalism\u000aChristian Identity movement\u000aDalit Nationalism\u000aDeaf culture\u000aDiaspora politics\u000aDisability rights movement\u000a{{Col-3}}\u000a\u000aEthnicity\u000aEqual Rights Amendment\u000aFat acceptance\u000aFather''s Rights\u000aFeminism\u000aGay Rights\u000aHindu Nationalism\u000aIrish nationalism\u000aIslamism\u000aJeunism\u000aMad pride\u000aMen''s rights\u000aMulticulturalism\u000aPan-Americanism\u000a{{Col-3}}\u000a\u000aPolitical Correctness\u000aPuerto Rican nationalism\u000aQuebec Nationalism\u000aQueercore\u000aQueer nationalism\u000aRacial politics\u000aRiot Grrl\u000aScottish Nationalism\u000aSeparatism\u000aUlster loyalism\u000aWhite nationalism\u000aWomen''s rights\u000aYoung Americans for Freedom\u000aZionism\u000a{{col-end}}\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aAdversarial process\u000aClient politics\u000aConflict theory\u000aConviction politics\u000aCultural marxism\u000aEthnic interest group\u000aGroup rights\u000aGroup polarization\u000aAuto-segregation\u000aEndogamy\u000aIdentity (social science)\u000aInterest group liberalism\u000aMinority influence\u000aPolitical consciousness\u000aSocial conflict theory\u000aStandpoint theory\u000aVoting bloc\u000a\u000a\u000aNotes{{Reflist}}\u000aReferences\u000a\u000aCarol Hanisch, &#34;The Personal is Political,&#34; in Shulamith Firestone, The Dialectic of Sex.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(20,0,'{{TOC right}}Epidemiology is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations, and serves as the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine. It is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research, and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease and determining optimal treatment approaches to clinical practice. In the study of communicable and non-communicable diseases, the work of epidemiologists ranges from outbreak investigation to study design, data collection and analysis including the development of statistical models to test hypotheses and the documentation of results for submission to peer-reviewed journals. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population, a condition known as a syndemic. Epidemiologists rely on a number of other scientific disciplines such as biology (to better understand disease processes), biostatistics (the current raw information available), Geographic Information Science (to store data and map disease patterns) and social science disciplines (to better understand proximate and distal risk factors).\u000aEtymologyEpidemiology, "the study of what is upon the people", is derived from the Greek terms epi = upon, among; demos = people, district; logos = study, word, discourse; suggesting that it applies only to human populations. But the term is widely used in studies of zoological populations (veterinary epidemiology), although the term ''epizoology'' is available, and it has also been applied to studies of plant populations (botanical epidemiology).{{cite journal}}The distinction  between ''epidemic'' and ''endemic'' was first drawn by HippocratesHippocrates. (~200BC). Airs, Waters, Places., to distinguish between diseases that are ''visited upon'' a population (epidemic) from those that ''reside within'' a population (endemic).Carol Buck, Alvaro Llopis, Enrique N\u00e1jera, Milton Terris. (1998). The Challenge of Epidemiology: Issues and Selected Readings. Scientific Publication No. 505. Pan American Health Organization. Washington, DC. p3. The term ''epidemiology'' appears to have first been used to describe the study of epidemics in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba in Epidemiolog\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola. As described above, the term epidemiology has expanded considerably in scope since to cover the description and causation of not only epidemic disease, but of disease in general, and even many non-disease health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and obesity.\u000aHistory{{Disputed-section}}\u000aThe Greek physician Hippocrates is sometimes said to be the father of epidemiology. He is the first person known to have examined the relationships between the occurrence of disease and environmental influences. He coined the terms endemic (for diseases usually found in some places but not in others) and epidemic (for disease that are seen at some times but not others).{{cite web}}One of the earliest theories on the origin of disease was that it was primarily the fault of human luxury. This was expressed by philosophers such as Plato{{cite web}} and Rousseau,{{cite web}} and social critics like Jonathan Swift.{{cite web}}In the medieval Islamic world, physicians discovered the contagious nature of infectious disease. In particular, the Persian physician Avicenna, considered a "father of modern medicine,"{{cite journal}} in The Canon of Medicine (1020s), discovered the contagious nature of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease, and the distribution of disease through water and soil.George Sarton, Introduction to the History of Science. (cf. Dr. A. Zahoor and Dr. Z. Haq (1997), Quotations From Famous Historians of Science, Cyberistan. Avicenna stated that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected. He introduced the method of quarantine as a means of limiting the spread of contagious disease.{{cite journal}} He also proposed the idea of a syndrome in the diagnosis of specific diseases.{{cite book}}When the Black Death (bubonic plague) reached Al Andalus in the 14th century, Ibn Khatima hypothesized that infectious diseases are caused by "minute bodies" which enter the human body and cause disease. Another 14th century Andalusian-Arabian physician, Ibn al-Khatib (1313\u20131374), wrote a treatise called On the Plague, in which he stated how infectious disease can be transmitted through bodily contact and "through garments, vessels and earrings."Ibrahim B. Syed, Ph.D. (2002). "Islamic Medicine: 1000 years ahead of its times" Journal of the Islamic Medical Association ''2, p. 2-9.In the middle of the 16th century, a famous Italian doctor from Verona named Girolamo Fracastoro was the first to propose a theory that these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were considered to be able to spread by air, multiply by themselves and to be destroyable by fire. In this way he refuted Galen''s miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543 he wrote a book De contagione et contagiosis morbis, in which he was the first to promote personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.John Graunt, a professional haberdasher and serious amateur scientist, published Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality in 1662. In it, he used analysis of the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague to present one of the first life tables and report time trends for many diseases, new and old. He provided statistical evidence for many theories on disease, and also refuted many widespread ideas on them.Dr. John Snow is famous for his investigations into the causes of the 19th Century Cholera epidemics.  He began with noticing the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Company. His identification of the Broad Street pump as the cause of the Soho epidemic is considered the classic example of epidemiology.  He used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and had the handle removed, thus ending the outbreak. (It has been questioned as to whether the epidemic was already in decline when Snow took action.) This has been perceived as a major event in the history of public health and can be regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.Other pioneers include Danish physician P. A. Schleisner, who in 1849 related his work on the prevention of the epidemic of tetanus neonatorum on the Vestmanna Islands in Iceland{{cite web}}. Another important pioneer was Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who in 1847 brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure. His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister ''discovered'' antiseptics in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur.In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross, Anderson Gray McKendrick and others.Another breakthrough was the 1954 publication of the results of a British Doctors Study, led by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill, which lent very strong statistical support to the suspicion that tobacco smoking was linked to lung cancer.\u000a\u000aHistory of emerging infectious diseases\u000a\u000a\u000aThe professionTo date, few universities offer epidemiology as a course of study at the undergraduate level. Many epidemiologists are physicians, or hold graduate degrees such as a Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science or Epidemiology (MSc.). Doctorates include the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Doctor of Science (ScD), or for clinically trained physicians, Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) . In the United Kingdom, the title of ''doctor'' is by long custom used to refer to general medical practitioners, whose professional degrees are usually those of Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS or MBChB). As public health/health protection practitioners, epidemiologists work in a number of different settings. Some epidemiologists work ''in the field''; i.e., in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service and are often at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Protection Agency, The World Health Organisation (WHO), or the Public Health Agency of Canada.\u000aThe practiceEpidemiologists employ a range of study designs from the observational to experimental and  generally categorized as descriptive, analytic (aiming to further examine known associations or hypothesized relationships), and experimental (a term often equated with clinical or community trials of treatments and other interventions). Epidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between exposures such as alcohol or smoking, biological agents, stress, or chemicals to mortality or morbidity. The identification of causal relationships between these exposures and outcomes is an important aspect of epidemiology.  Modern epidemiologists use informatics as a tool.The term ''epidemiologic triad'' is used to describe the intersection of Host, Agent, and Environment in analyzing an outbreak.\u000aAs causal inferenceAlthough epidemiology is sometimes viewed as a collection of statistical tools used to elucidate the associations of exposures to health outcomes, a deeper understanding of this science is that of discovering causal relationships.It is nearly impossible to say with perfect accuracy how even the most simple physical systems behave beyond the immediate future, much less the complex field of epidemiology, which draws on biology, sociology, mathematics, statistics, anthropology, psychology, and policy; "Correlation does not imply causation" is a common theme for much of the epidemiological literature. For epidemiologists, the key is in the term inference. Epidemiologists use gathered data and a broad range of biomedical and psychosocial theories in an iterative way to generate or expand theory, to test hypotheses, and to make educated, informed assertions about which relationships are causal, and about exactly how they are causal. Epidemiologists Rothman and Greenland emphasize that the "one cause - one effect" understanding is a simplistic mis-belief. Most outcomes, whether disease or death, are caused by a chain or web consisting of many component causes. Causes can be distinguished as necessary, sufficient or probabilistic conditions. If a necessary condition can be identified and controlled (e.g., antibodies to a disease agent), the harmful outcome can be avoided.\u000aBradford-Hill criteriaIn 1965 Austin Bradford Hill detailed criteria for assessing evidence of causation.{{cite journal}} These guidelines are sometimes referred to as the Bradford-Hill criteria, but this makes it seem like it is some sort of checklist. For example, Phillips and Goodman (2004) note that they are often taught or referenced as a checklist for assessing causality, despite this not being Hill''s intention.{{cite journal}} Hill himself said "None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required sine qua non".\u000a\u000aStrength: A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.\u000aConsistency: Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.\u000aSpecificity: Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.\u000aTemporality: The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).\u000aBiological gradient: Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.\u000aPlausibility: A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).\u000aCoherence: Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that &#34;... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations&#34; .\u000aExperiment: &#34;Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence&#34; .\u000aAnalogy: The effect of similar factors may be considered.\u000a\u000aA useful mnemonic for remembering these criteria is ''ACCESS PTB''.\u000aLegal interpretationEpidemiological studies can only go to prove that an agent could have caused, but not that it did cause, an effect in any particular case:"Epidemiology is concerned with the incidence of disease in populations and does not address the question of the cause of an individual\u2019s disease. This question, sometimes referred to as specific causation, is beyond the domain of the science of epidemiology. Epidemiology has its limits at the point where an inference is made that the relationship between an agent and a disease is causal (general causation) and where the magnitude of excess risk attributed to the agent has been determined; that is, epidemiology addresses whether an agent can cause a disease, not whether an agent did cause a specific plaintiff\u2019s disease."{{cite book}}\u000aIn United States law, epidemiology alone cannot prove that a causal association does not exist in general. Conversely, it can be (and is in some circumstances) taken by US courts, in an individual case, to justify an inference that a causal association does exist, based upon a balance of probability.\u000aAdvocacyAs a public health discipline, epidemiologic evidence is often used to advocate both personal measures like diet change and corporate measures like removal of junk food advertising, with study findings disseminated to the general public in order to help people to make informed decisions about their health. Often the uncertainties about these findings are not communicated well; news articles often prominently report the latest result of one study with little mention of its limitations, caveats, or context. Epidemiological tools have proved effective in establishing major causes of diseases like cholera and lung cancer but have had problems with more subtle health issues, and several recent epidemiological results on medical treatments (for example, on the effects of hormone replacement therapy) have been refuted by later randomized controlled trials.{{cite news}}\u000aPopulation-based health managementEpidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to emerging population-based health management frameworks.Population-based health management encompasses the ability to:\u000a\u000aAssess the health states and health needs of a target population;\u000aImplement and evaluate interventions that are designed to improve the health of that population; and\u000aEfficiently and effectively provide care for members of that population in a way that is consistent with the community\u2019s cultural, policy and health resource values.\u000a\u000aModern population-based health management is complex, requiring a multiple set of skills (medical, political, technological, mathematical etc.) of which epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component, that is unified with management science to provide efficient and effective health care and health guidance to a population. This task requires the forward looking ability of modern risk management approaches that transform health risk factors, incidence, prevalence and mortality statistics (derived from epidemiological analysis) into management metrics that not only guide how a health system responds to current population health issues, but also how a health system can be managed to better respond to future potential population health issues.Examples of organizations that use population-based health management that leverage the work and results of epidemiological practice include Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control, Health Canada Tobacco Control Programs, Rick Hansen Foundation, Canadian Tobacco Control Research Initiative.{{cite conference}}{{cite conference}}{{cite conference}}Each of these organizations use a population-based health management framework called Life at Risk that combines epidemiological quantitative analysis with demographics, health agency operational research and economics to perform:\u000a\u000aPopulation Life Impacts Simulations: Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the population with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death as well as potential years of life lost from disability and death;\u000aLabour Force Life Impacts Simulations: Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon the labour force with respect to new disease cases, prevalence, premature death and potential years of life lost from disability and death;\u000aEconomic Impacts of Disease Simulations: Measurement of the future potential impact of disease upon private sector disposable income impacts (wages, corporate profits, private health care costs) and public sector disposable income impacts (personal income tax, corporate income tax, consumption taxes, publicly funded health care costs).\u000a\u000a\u000aTypes of studies{{Main}}\u000aCase seriesCase-series may refer to the qualititative study of the experience of a single patient, or small group of patients with a similar diagnosis, or to a statistical technique comparing periods during which patients are exposed to some factor with the potential to produce illness with periods when they are unexposed.The former type of study is purely descriptive and cannot be used to make inferences about the general population of patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient''s history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies. A case control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease\u2019s natural history.{{cite book}}The latter type, more formally described as self-controlled case-series studies, divide individual patient follow-up time into exposed and unexposed periods and use fixed-effects poisson regression processes to compare the incidence rate of a given outcome between exposed and unexposed periods. This technique has been extensively used in the study of adverse reactions to vaccination, and has been shown to provide statistical power comparable to that available in cohort studies.\u000aCase control studiesCase control studies select subjects based on their disease status. A group of individuals that are disease positive (the "case" group) is compared with a group of disease negative individuals (the "control" group). The control group should ideally come from the same population that gave rise to the cases. The case control study looks back through time at potential exposures that both groups (cases and controls) may have encountered. A 2x2 table is constructed, displaying exposed cases (A), exposed controls (B), unexposed cases (C) and unexposed controls (D). The statistic generated to measure association is the odds ratio (OR), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases (A/C) to the odds of exposure in the controls (B/D), i.e. OR = (A/C) / (B/D) .\u000a\u000a..... Cases Controls \u000aExposed A B \u000aUnexposed C D \u000aIf the OR is clearly greater than 1, then the conclusion is "those with the disease are more likely to have been exposed," whereas if it is close to 1 then the exposure and disease are not likely associated. If the OR is far less than one, then this suggests that the exposure is a protective factor in the causation of the disease.Case control studies are usually faster and more cost effective than cohort studies, but are sensitive to bias (such as recall bias and selection bias). The main challenge is to identify the appropriate control group; the distribution of exposure among the control group should be representative of the distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases. This can be achieved by drawing a random sample from the original population at risk. This has as a consequence that the control group can contain people with the disease under study when the disease has a high attack rate in a population.\u000aCohort studiesCohort studies select subjects based on their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation at the beginning of the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2x2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the Relative Risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe&nbsp;=&nbsp;A&nbsp;/&nbsp;(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, Pu&nbsp;=&nbsp;C&nbsp;/&nbsp;(C+D), i.e. RR&nbsp;=&nbsp;Pe&nbsp;/&nbsp;Pu.\u000a\u000a..... Case Non case Total \u000aExposed A B (A+B) \u000aUnexposed C D (C+D) \u000aAs with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read "those with the exposure were more likely to develop disease."Prospective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful effect measure than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.\u000aOutbreak investigation\u000a\u000aFor information on investigation of infectious disease outbreaks, please see outbreak investigation.\u000a\u000a\u000aValidity: precision and bias\u000aRandom errorRandom error is the result of fluctuations around a true value because of sampling variability. Random error is just that: random. It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis. Examples of random error include: poorly worded questions, a misunderstanding in interpreting an individual answer from a particular respondent, or a typographical error during coding. Random error affects measurement in a transient, inconsistent manner and it is impossible to correct for random error.There is random error in all sampling procedures. This is called sampling error.Precision in epidemiological variables is a measure of random error. Precision is also inversely related to random error, so that to reduce random error is to increase precision. Confidence intervals are computed to demonstrate the precision of relative risk estimates. The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the relative risk estimate.There are two basic ways to reduce random error in an epidemiological study. The first is to increase the sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise measuring device or by increasing the number of measurements.Note, that if sample size or number of measurements are increased, or a more precise measuring tool is purchased, the costs of the study are usually increased. There is usually an uneasy balance between the need for adequate precision and the practical issue of study cost.\u000aSystematic errorA systematic error or bias occurs when there is a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of systematic error is if, unbeknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The measuring device could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).A mistake in coding that affects all responses for that particular question is another example of a systematic error.The validity of a study is dependent on the degree of systematic error. Validity is usually separated into two components:\u000a\u000aInternal validity is dependent on the amount of error in measurements, including exposure, disease, and the associations between these variables. Good internal validity implies a lack of error in measurement and suggests that inferences may be drawn at least as they pertain to the subjects under study.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExternal validity pertains to the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.\u000a\u000a\u000aSelection biasSelection bias is one of three types of bias that threatens the validity of a study. Selection bias is an inaccurate measure of effect which results from a systematic difference in the relation between exposure and disease between those who are in the study and those who should be in the study.If one or more of the sampled groups does not accurately represent the population they are intended to represent, then the results of that comparison may be misleading.Selection bias can produce either an overestimation or underestimation of the effect measure. It can also produce an effect when none actually exists.An example of selection bias is volunteer bias. Volunteers may not be representative of the true population. They may exhibit exposures or outcomes which may differ from nonvolunteers (e.g. volunteers tend to be healthier or they may seek out the study because they already have a problem with the disease being studied and want free treatment).Another type of selection bias is caused by non-respondents. For example, women who have been subjected to politically motivated sexual assault may be more fearful of participating in a survey measuring incidents of mass rape than non-victims, leading researchers to underestimate the number of rapes.To reduce selection bias, you should develop explicit (objective) definitions of exposure and/or disease. You should strive for high participation rates. Have a large sample size and randomly select the respondents so that you have a better chance of truly representing the population.\u000aJournalsA list of journals:{{cite web}}\u000aGeneral journals\u000a\u000aAmerican Journal of Epidemiology\u000aCanadian Journal of Epidemiology and Biostatistics\u000aEpidemiologic Reviews\u000aEpidemiology\u000aInternational Journal of Epidemiology\u000aAnnals of Epidemiology\u000aJournal of Epidemiology and Community Health\u000aEuropean Journal of Epidemiology\u000aEmerging themes in epidemiology\u000aEpidemiologic Perspectives and Innovations\u000aEurosurveillance\u000a\u000a\u000aSpecialty journals\u000a\u000aCancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention\u000aGenetic epidemiology\u000aJournal of Clinical Epidemiology\u000aPaediatric Perinatal Epidemiology\u000aEpidemiology and Infection\u000aPharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety\u000a\u000a\u000aAreas\u000aBy physiology/disease\u000a\u000aInfectious disease epidemiology\u000aCardiovascular disease epidemiology\u000aCancer epidemiology\u000aNeuroepidemiology\u000aEpidemiology of Aging\u000aOral/Dental epidemiology\u000aReproductive epidemiology\u000aObesity/diabetes epidemiology\u000aRenal epidemiology\u000aIntestinal epidemiology\u000aPsychiatric epidemiology\u000aVeterinary epidemiology\u000aEpidemiology of zoonosis\u000aRespiratory Epidemiology\u000aPediatric Epidemiology\u000aQuantitative parasitology\u000a\u000a\u000aBy methodological approach\u000a\u000aEnvironmental epidemiology\u000aEconomic epidemiology\u000aClinical epidemiology\u000aConflict epidemiology\u000aGenetic epidemiology\u000aMolecular epidemiology\u000aNutritional epidemiology\u000aSocial epidemiology\u000aLifecourse epidemiology\u000aEpi methods development / Biostatistics\u000aMeta-analysis\u000aSpatial epidemiology\u000aTele-epidemiology\u000aBiomarker epidemiology\u000aPharmacoepidemiology\u000aPrimary care epidemiology\u000aInfection control and hospital epidemiology\u000aPublic Health practice epidemiology\u000aSurveillance epidemiology (Clinical surveillance)\u000aDisease Informatics\u000a\u000a\u000aSee also\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences\u000aNotes{{Reflist}}\u000aBibliography{{refbegin}}\u000a\u000aClayton, David and Michael Hills (1993) Statistical Models in Epidemiology Oxford University Press.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(21,0,'{{Psychology sidebar}}Psychotherapy, or personal counselling with a psychotherapist, is an intentional interpersonal relationship used by trained psychotherapists to aid a client or patient in problems of living.It aims to increase the individual''s sense of their own well-being. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and that are designed to improve the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family).Psychotherapy may also be performed by practitioners with a number of different qualifications, including psychiatry, clinical psychology, counseling psychology, mental health counseling, clinical social work, marriage and family therapy, rehabilitation counseling, music therapy, occupational therapy, psychiatric nursing, psychoanalysis and others.Indeed, psychotherapy can increasingly be considered as a profession in its own right, and in Europe the European Association for Psychotherapy is promoting this view and has set professional training standards to this effect.\u000aHowever, some European countries have passed laws about psychotherapy that restrict its practice to the professions of psychology and psychiatry; Austria has a law that recognizes multi-disciplinary approaches; Italy is the only country that has preferred a limiting "medical approach" to psychotherapy; other European countries have preferred different approaches to psychotherapy such as self-regulation. In the United Kingdom the National Council of Psychotherapists was established in 1971 following the Foster Report on the registration of psychotherapists. Other professional bodies do merge psychotherapists from different backgrounds such as the BACP, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy that represents both counsellors and psychotherapists that was founded in 1977 and the UKCP, United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy established later in 1985. Over the last decade the British labour governments have tried to state regulate and control the profession through the Health Professions Council - an independent regulator for health professionals in the UK. Such a proposal has caused a lot of disappointment and most professionals and professional bodies have protested against the proposed legislation. Many points have been pointed out against the regulation through the HPC and many reports have been issued. One of them commissioned by the National Council of Psychotherapists has emphasized the risks of the unlikely approval of the proposed legislation which is considered to be partly against EU law and human rights in many of its parts (Amicarelli''s Report - Is HPC legal? available at http://www.ncphq.co.uk/page180.html).\u000aEtymologyThe word psychotherapy comes from the Ancient Greek words psych\u0113, meaning breath, spirit, or soul and therapeia or therapeuein, to nurse or cure.Your dictionary definition Its use was first noted around 1890.Merriam-Webster dictionary definition It is defined as the relief of distress or disability in one person by another, using an approach based on a particular theory or paradigm, and that the agent performing the therapy has had some form of training in delivering this. It is these latter two points which distinguish psychotherapy from other forms of counseling or caregiving.{{cite book}}\u000aFormsMost forms of psychotherapy use spoken conversation. Some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story or music. Psychotherapy with children and their parents often involves play, dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting.Schechter DS, Coates SW (2006). Relationally and Developmentally Focused Interventions with Young Children and Their Caregivers Affected by the Events of 9/11. In Y. Neria, R. Gross, R. Marshall,  E. Susser (Eds.)  September 11, 2001: Treatment, Research and Public Mental Health in the Wake of a Terrorist Attack, New York:  Cambridge University Press.  pp. 402-427. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.Therapy is generally used in response to a variety of specific or non-specific manifestations of clinically diagnosable and/or existential crises. Treatment of everyday problems is more often referred to as\u000acounseling (a distinction originally adopted by Carl Rogers). However, the term counseling is sometimes used interchangeably with "psychotherapy".While some psychotherapeutic interventions are designed to treat the patient using the medical model, many psychotherapeutic approaches do not adhere to the symptom-based model of "illness/cure". Some practitioners, such as humanistic therapists, see themselves more in a facilitative/helper role. As sensitive and deeply personal topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of confidentiality is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations'' codes of ethical practice.\u000aSystems{{wikinews}}\u000aThere are several main broad systems of psychotherapy:\u000a\u000aPsychoanalytic - it was the first practice to be called a psychotherapy. It encourages the verbalization of all the patient&#39;s thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the nature of the unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient&#39;s symptoms and character problems.\u000aCognitive behavioral - generally seeks to identify maladaptive cognition, appraisal, beliefs and reactions with the aim of influencing destructive negative emotions and problematic dysfunctional behaviors.\u000aPsychodynamic - is a form of depth psychology, whose primary focus is to reveal the unconscious content of a client&#39;s psyche in an effort to alleviate psychic tension. Although its roots are in psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy tends to be briefer and less intensive than traditional psychoanalysis.\u000aExistential - is based on the existential belief that human beings are alone in the world. This isolation leads to feelings of meaninglessness, which can be overcome only by creating one&#39;s own values and meanings.  Existential therapy is philosophically associated with phenomenology.\u000aHumanistic - emerged in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis and is therefore known as the Third Force in the development of psychology. It is explicitly concerned with the human context of the development of the individual with an emphasis on subjective meaning, a rejection of determinism, and a concern for positive growth rather than pathology. It posits an inherent human capacity to maximize potential, &#39;the self-actualizing tendency&#39;. The task of Humanistic therapy is to create a relational environment where this tendency might flourish.  Humanistic psychology is philosophically rooted in existentialism.\u000aBrief - &#34;Brief therapy&#34; is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches to psychotherapy. It differs from other schools of therapy in that it emphasizes (1) a focus on a specific problem and (2) direct intervention. It is solution-based rather than problem-oriented. It is less concerned with how a problem arose than with the current factors sustaining it and preventing change.\u000aSystemic - seeks to address people not at an individual level, as is often the focus of other forms of therapy, but as people in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups, their patterns and dynamics (includes family therapy &#38; marriage counseling). Community psychology is a type of systemic psychology.\u000aTranspersonal - Addresses the client in the context of a spiritual understanding of consciousness.\u000a\u000aThere are hundreds of psychotherapeutic approaches or schools of thought.  By 1980 there were more than 250Henrick 1980; by 1996 there were more than 450Maclennan 1996. The development of new and hybrid approaches continues around the wide variety of theoretical backgrounds. Many practitioners use several approaches in their work and alter their approach based on client need.\u000a\u000aSee the list of psychotherapies for an extended list of individual psychotherapies.\u000a\u000a\u000aHistory{{See also}}In an informal sense, psychotherapy can be said to have been practiced through the ages, as individuals received psychological counsel and reassurance from others. Philosophers and physicians from the Hellenistic schools of philosophy and therapy practised psychotherapy among the Ancient Greeks and Romans from about the late 4th century BC to the 4th century AD."Which psychotherapy?: leading exponents explain their differences". Colin Feltham (1997). p.80. ISBN 0803974795 The Greek physician Hippocrates (460\u2013 377 BC) viewed mental illnesses as phenomena that could be studied and treated empirically."Persuasion and healing: a comparative study of psychotherapy". Jerome D. Frank, Julia B. Frank (1993). p.4. ISBN 0801846366 Purposeful, theoretically-based psychotherapy was probably first developed in the Middle East during the 9th century by the Persian physician and psychological thinker, Rhazes (AD 852-932), who was at one time the chief physician of the Baghdad hospital.{{Citation needed}} At that time in Europe, serious mental disorders were generally treated as demonic or medical conditions requiring punishment and confinement until the advent of moral treatment approaches in the 18th Century.{{Citation needed}} This brought about a focus on the possibility of psychosocial intervention - including reasoning, moral encouragement, and group activities - to rehabilitate the "insane".Psychoanalysis was perhaps the first specific school of psychotherapy, developed by Sigmund Freud and others through the early 1900s. Trained as a neurologist, Freud began focusing on problems that appeared to have no discernible organic basis, and theorized that they had psychological causes originating in childhood experiences and the unconscious mind. Techniques such as dream interpretation, free association, transference and analysis of the id, ego and superego were developed. Many theorists, including Anna Freud, Alfred Adler, Carl Jung, Karen Horney, Otto Rank, Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein, and Heinz Kohut,  built upon Freud''s fundamental ideas and often formed their own differentiating systems of psychotherapy. These were all later categorized as psychodynamic, meaning anything that involved the psyche''s conscious/unconscious influence on external relationships and the self. Sessions tended to number into the hundreds over several years.Behaviorism developed in the 1920s, and behavior modification as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and Hans Eysenck in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States. Behavioral therapy approaches relied on principles of operant conditioning, classical conditioning and social learning theory to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for phobias, as well as other disorders.Some therapeutic approaches developed out of the European school of existential philosophy. Concerned mainly with the individual''s ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field in the US (e.g., Irvin Yalom, Rollo May) and Europe (Viktor Frankl, Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, R.D.Laing, Emmy van Deurzen) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common ''life crises'' springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche). The uniqueness of the patient-therapist relationship thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic enquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with Carl Rogers. Based on existentialism and the works of Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of human needs, Rogers brought person-centered psychotherapy into mainstream focus.  The primary requirement of Rogers is that the client should be in receipt of three core ''conditions'' from their counsellor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, also sometimes described as ''prizing'' the person or valuing the humanity of an individual, congruence [authenticity/genuineness/transparency], and empathic understanding. The aim in using the ''core conditions'' is to facilitate therapeutic change within a non-directive relationship conducive to enhancing the client''s psychological well being. This type of interaction enables the client to fully experience and express themselves.  Others developed the approach, like Fritz and Laura Perls in the creation of Gestalt therapy, as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of Nonviolent Communication, and  Eric Berne, founder of Transactional Analysis.  Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as humanistic psychotherapy today. Self-help groups and books became widespread.During the 1950s, Albert Ellis originated Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). A few years later, psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck developed a form of psychotherapy known as cognitive therapy. Both of these included generally relative short, structured and present-focused therapy aimed at identifying and changing a person''s beliefs, appraisals and reaction-patterns, by contrast with the more long-lasting insight-based approach of psycho-dynamic or humanistic therapies.  Cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches were combined and grouped under the heading and umbrella-term Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the 1970s. Many approaches within CBT were oriented towards active/directive collaborative empiricism and mapping, assessing and modifying clients core beliefs and dysfunctional schemas. These approaches gained widespread acceptance as a primary treatment for numerous disorders. A "third wave" of cognitive and behavioral therapies developed, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Dialectical behavior therapy, which expanded the concepts to other disorders and/or added novel components and mindfulness exercises. Counseling methods developed, including solution-focused therapy and systemic coaching.Postmodern psychotherapies such as Narrative Therapy and Coherence Therapy did not impose definitions of mental health and illness, but rather saw the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and therapist in a social context. Systems Therapy also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics\u2014and Transpersonal psychology, which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other important orientations developed in the last three decades include Feminist therapy, Brief therapy, Somatic Psychology, Expressive therapy, applied Positive psychology and the Human Givens approach which is building on the best of what has gone before{{Cite journal}}. A survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed the most utilized models of therapy and the ten most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century.The Top 10: The Most Influential Therapists of the Past Quarter-Century. Psychotherapy Networker.: 2007, March/April (retrieved 11 Sept 2007)\u000aGeneral concernsPsychotherapy can be seen as an interpersonal invitation offered by (often trained and regulated) psychotherapists to aid clients in reaching their full potential or to cope better with problems of life. Psychotherapists usually receive remuneration in some form in return for their time and skills. This is one way in which the relationship can be distinguished from an altruistic offer of assistance.Psychotherapists and counselors often require to create a therapeutic environment referred to as the frame, which is characterized by a free yet secure climate that enables the client to open up. The degree to which client feels related to the therapist may well depend on the methods and approaches used by the therapist or counselor.Psychotherapy often includes techniques to increase awareness, for example, or to enable other choices of thought, feeling or action; to increase the sense of well-being and to better manage subjective discomfort or distress. Psychotherapy can be provided on a one-to-one basis or in group therapy. It can occur face to face, over the telephone, or, much less commonly, the Internet. Its time frame may be a matter of weeks or many years. Therapy may address specific forms of diagnosable mental illness, or everyday problems in managing or maintaining person relationships or meeting personal goals. Treatment of everyday problems is more often referred to as counseling (a distinction originally adopted by Carl Rogers) but the term is sometimes used interchangeably with "psychotherapy".Psychotherapists use a range of techniques to influence or persuade the client to adapt or change in the direction the client has chosen. These can be based on clear thinking about their options; experiential relationship building; dialogue, communication and adoption of behavior change strategies. Each is designed to improve the mental health of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use other forms of communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Because sensitive topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality.Psychotherapists are often trained, certified, and licensed, with a range of different certifications and licensing requirements depending on the jurisdiction. Psychotherapy may be undertaken by clinical psychologists,counseling psychologists, social workers, marriage-family therapists, expressive therapists, trained nurses, psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, mental health counselors, school counselors, or professionals of other mental health disciplines.Psychiatrists have medical qualifications and may also administer prescription medication.  The primary training of a psychiatrist focuses on the biological aspects of mental health conditions, with some training in psychotherapy. Psychologists have more training in psychological assessment and research, and have in-depth training in psychotherapy. Social workers have specialized training in linking patients to community and institutional resources, in addition to elements of psychological assessment and psychotherapy. Marriage-family therapists have specific training and experience working with relationships and family issues. A licensed professional counselor (LPC) generally has special training in career, mental health, school, or rehabilitation counseling to include evaluation and assessments as well as psychotherapy. Many of the wide variety of training programs are multiprofessional, that is, psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, and social workers may be found in the same training group. Consequently, specialized psychotherapeutic training in most countries requires a program of continuing education after the basic degree, or involves multiple certifications attached to one specific degree.\u000aSpecific schools and approaches\u000a{{Main}}In practices of experienced psychotherapists, typically therapy is not pure a type, but draws aspects from a number of perspectives and schools.Hans Strupp and Jeffrey Binder, Psychotherapy in a New Key. New York, Basic Books, 1984, ISBN 9780465067473Anthony Roth and Peter Fonagy, What Works for Whom? A Critical Review of Psychotherapy Research, Guilford Press, 2005, ISBN 572306505\u000aPsychoanalysis{{Main}}\u000aPsychoanalysis was developed in the late 1800s by Sigmund Freud. His therapy explores the dynamic workings of a mind understood to consist of three parts: the hedonistic id (German: das Es, "the it"), the rational ego (das Ich, "the I"), and the moral superego (das \u00dcberich, "the above-I"). Because the majority of these dynamics are said to occur outside people''s awareness, Freudian psychoanalysis seeks to probe the unconscious by way of various techniques, including dream interpretation and free association. Freud maintained that the condition of the unconscious mind is profoundly influenced by childhood experiences. So, in addition to dealing with the defense mechanisms used by an overburdened ego, his therapy addresses fixations and other issues by probing deeply into clients'' youth.Other psychodynamic theories and techniques have been developed and used by psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, personal growth facilitators,  occupational therapists and social workers. Techniques for group therapy have also been developed. While behaviour is often a target of the work, many approaches value working with feelings and thoughts. This is especially true of the psychodynamic schools of psychotherapy, which today include Jungian therapy and Psychodrama as well as the psychoanalytic schools.\u000aGestalt therapy{{Main}}Gestalt Therapy is a major overhaul of psychoanalysis.  In its early development it was called "concentration therapy" by its founders, Frederick and Laura Perls.  However, its mix of theoretical influences became most organized around the work of the gestalt psychologists; thus, by the time ''Gestalt Therapy, Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality'' (Perls, Hefferline, and Goodman) was written, the approach became known as "Gestalt Therapy."Gestalt Therapy stands on top of essentially four load bearing theoretical walls:  phenomenological method, dialogical relationship, field-theoretical strategies, and experimental freedom.  Some have considered it an existential phenomenology while others have described it as a phenomenological behaviorism.  Gestalt therapy is a humanistic, holistic, and experiential approach that does not rely on talking alone, but facilitates awareness in the various contexts of life by moving from talking about situations relatively remote to action and direct, current experience.\u000aGroup psychotherapy{{Main}}The therapeutic use of groups in modern clinical practice can be traced to the early 20th century, when the American chest physician Pratt, working in Boston, described forming ''classes'' of 15 to 20 patients with tuberculosis who had been rejected for sanatorium treatment.{{Citation needed}} The term group therapy, however, was first used around 1920 by Jacob L. Moreno, whose main contribution was the development of psychodrama, in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment under the direction of the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the USA, such as Paul Schilder, who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably Wilfred Bion and Rickman, followed by S. H. Foulkes, Main, and Bridger. The Northfield Hospital in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two ''Northfield Experiments'', which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the therapeutic community movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings. It has been shown to be as or more effective than individual therapy.Dr. Cara Gardenswartz  2009, Los Angeles, CA\u000aMedical and non-medical modelsA distinction can also be made between those psychotherapies that employ a medical model and those that employ a humanistic model. In the medical model the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health.  The extensive use of the DSM-IV, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders in the United States, is an example of a medically-exclusive model.The humanistic model of non medical in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. The therapist attempts to create a relational environment conducive to experiential learning and help build the client''s confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves.  An example would be gestalt therapy.Some psychodynamic practitioners distinguish between more uncovering and more supportive psychotherapy.  Uncovering psychotherapy emphasizes facilitating the client''s insight into the roots of their difficulties.  The best-known example of an uncovering psychotherapy is classical psychoanalysis.  Supportive psychotherapy by contrast stresses strengthening the client''s defenses and often providing encouragement and advice.  Depending on the client''s personality, a more supportive or more uncovering approach may be optimal.  Most psychotherapists use a combination of uncovering and supportive approaches.\u000aCognitive behavioral therapy{{Main}}Cognitive behavioral therapy refers to a range of techniques which focus on the construction and re-construction of people''s cognitions, emotions and behaviors. Generally in CBT the therapist, through a wide array of modalities, helps clients assess, recognize and deal with problematic and dysfunctional ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.\u000aBehavior therapy{{Main}}\u000aBehavior therapy focuses on modifying overt behavior and helping clients to achieve goals. This approach is built on the principles of learning theory including operant and respondent conditioning, which makes up the area of applied behavior analysis or behavior modification. This approach includes acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. Sometimes it is integrated with cognitive therapy to make cognitive behavior therapy.  By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behavior ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behavior as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analyzing bidirectional interactions).{{cite book}}\u000aBody-oriented psychotherapy{{Main}}\u000aBody-oriented psychotherapy or Body Psychotherapy is also known as Somatic Psychology, especially in the USA. There are many very different psychotherapeutic approaches. They generally focus on the link between the mind and the body and try to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater awareness of the physical body and the emotions which gave rise to the various body-oriented based psychotherapeutic approaches, such as Reichian (Wilhelm Reich) Character-Analytic Vegetotherapy and Orgonomy; neo-Reichian Alexander Lowen''s Bioenergetic analysis; Peter Levine''s Somatic Experiencing; Jack Rosenberg''s Integrative body psychotherapy; Ron Kurtz''s Hakomi psychotherapy; Pat Ogden''s sensorimotor psychotherapy; David Boadella''s Biosynthesis psychotherapy; Gerda Boyesen''s Biodynamic psychotherapy; etc.\u000aThese body-oriented psychotherapies are not to be confused with alternative medicine body-work or body-therapies that seek primarily to improve physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body because, despite the fact that bodywork techniques (for example Alexander Technique, Rolfing, and the Feldenkrais Method) can also affect the emotions, these techniques are not designed to work on psychological issues, neither are their practitioners so trained.\u000aExpressive therapy{{Main}}\u000aExpressive therapy is a form of therapy that utilizes artistic expression as its core means of treating clients.  Expressive therapists use the different disciplines of the creative arts as therapeutic interventions.  This includes the modalities dance therapy, drama therapy,  art therapy, music therapy, writing therapy, among others.  Expressive therapists believe that often the most effective way of treating a client is through the expression of imagination in a creative work and integrating and processing what issues are raised in the act.\u000aNarrative therapy{{Main}}\u000aNarrative therapy gives attention to each person''s "dominant story" by means of therapeutic conversations, which also may involve exploring unhelpful ideas and how they came to prominence. Possible social and cultural influences may be explored if the client deems it helpful.\u000aIntegrative psychotherapy{{Main}}\u000aIntegrative psychotherapy is an attempt to combine ideas and strategies from more than one theoretical approach.Handbook of Psychotherapy, (Norcross&Goldried, 2005) These approaches include mixing core beliefs and combining proven techniques. Forms of integrative psychotherapy include multimodal therapy, the transtheoretical model, cyclical psychodynamics, systematic treatment selection, cognitive analytic therapy, Internal Family Systems Model, multitheoretical psychotherapy and conceptual interaction. In practice, most experienced psychotherapists develop their own integrative approach over time.\u000aHypnotherapy{{Main}}\u000aHypnotherapy is therapy that is undertaken with a subject in hypnosis. Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject''s behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development.\u000aAdaptations for children\u000aCounseling and psychotherapy must be adapted to meet the developmental needs of children. Many counseling preparation programs include courses in human development. Since children often do not have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, counselors will use a variety of media such as crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), toys, board games, et cetera. The use of play therapy is often rooted in psychodynamic theory, but other approaches such as Solution Focused Brief Counseling may also employ the use of play in counseling. In many cases the counselor may prefer to work with the care taker of the child, especially if the child is younger than age four.  Yet, by doing so, the counselor risks the perpetuation of maladaptive interactive patterns and the adverse effects on development that have already been affected on the child''s end of the relationshipSchechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  When parenting becomes unthinkable: Intervening with traumatized parents and their toddlers.  Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,  48(3), 249-254.  Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with this young age group has leaned towards working with parent and child simultaneously within the interaction, as well as individually as needed.Lieberman, A.F., Van Horn, P., Ippen, C.G. (2005). Towards evidence-based treatment: Child-parent psychotherapy with preschoolers exposed to marital violence. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 44, 1241-1248.\u000aConfidentiality{{Further}}\u000aConfidentiality is an integral part of the therapeutic relationship and psychotherapy in general.\u000aCriticisms and questions regarding effectivenessWithin the psychotherapeutic community there has been some discussion of empirically-based psychotherapy, e.g.{{Cite journal}}Virtually no comparisons of different psychotherapies with long follow-up times have been done.{{Cite journal}} The Helsinki Psychotherapy StudyHelsinki Psychotherapy Study is a randomized clinical trial, in which patients are monitored for 12 months after the onset of study treatments, of which each lasted approximately 6 months. The assessments are to be completed at the baseline examination and during the follow-up after 3, 7, and 9 months and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 years. The final results of this trial are yet to be published because follow-up evaluations continued up to 2009.There is considerable controversy about which form of psychotherapy is most effective, and more specifically, which types of therapy are optimal for treating which sorts of problems.For Psychotherapy''s Claims, Skeptics Demand Proof Benedict Carey, The New York Times, August 10, 2004. Accessed  December 2006 Furthermore, it is controversial whether the form of therapy or the presence of factors common to many psychotherapies best separates effective therapy from ineffective therapy. Common factors theory asserts it is precisely the factors common to the most psychotherapies that make any psychotherapy successful: this is the quality of the therapeutic relationship.The dropout level is quite high; one meta-analysis of 125 studies concluded that the mean dropout rate was 46.86%.{{Cite journal}} The high level of dropout has raised some criticism about the relevance and efficacy of psychotherapy.Psychotherapy outcome research\u2014in which the effectiveness of psychotherapy is measured by questionnaires given to patients before, during, and after treatment\u2014has had difficulty distinguishing between the success or failure of the different approaches to therapy.  Those who stay with their therapist for longer periods are more likely to report positively on what develops into a longer-term relationship.  This suggests that some "treatment" may be open-ended with concerns associated with ongoing financial costs.As early as 1952, in one of the earliest studies of psychotherapy treatment, Hans Eysenck reported that two thirds of therapy patients improved significantly or recovered on their own within two years, whether or not they received psychotherapy.{{cite book}}Many psychotherapists believe that the nuances of psychotherapy cannot be captured by questionnaire-style observation, and prefer to rely on their own clinical experiences and conceptual arguments to support the type of treatment they practice.In 2001, Bruce Wampold of the University of Wisconsin published the book The Great Psychotherapy DebateThe Great Psychotherapy Debate Bruce E. Wampold, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison . Accessed December 2006.  In it Wampold, a former statistician who went on to train as a counseling psychologist, reported that\u000a\u000apsychotherapy is indeed effective,\u000athe type of treatment is not a factor,\u000athe theoretical bases of the techniques used, and the strictness of adherence to those techniques are both not factors,\u000athe therapist&#39;s strength of belief in the efficacy of the technique is a factor,\u000athe personality of the therapist is a significant factor,\u000athe alliance between the patient(s) and the therapist (meaning affectionate and trusting feelings toward the therapist, motivation and collaboration of the client, and empathic response of the therapist) is a key factor.\u000a\u000aWampold therefore concludes that "we do not know why psychotherapy works".Although the Great Psychotherapy Debate dealt primarily with data on depressed patients, subsequent articles have made similar findings for post-traumatic stress disorderBenish, S. G., Imel, Z. E., \& Wampold, B. E. (in press).

D., Wampold, B. E., & Varhely, K. (In press).  Direct comparisons of treatment modalities for youth disorders: A meta-analysis.  Psychotherapy ResearchSome report that by attempting to program or manualize treatment, psychotherapists may be reducing efficacy, although the unstructured approach of many psychotherapists cannot appeal to patients motivated to solve their difficulties through the application of specific techniques different from their past "mistakes."Critics of psychotherapy are skeptical of the healing power of a psychotherapeutic relationship.1988. Against Therapy: Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing. ISBN 0-689-11929-1, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson Because any intervention takes time, critics note that the passage of time alone, without therapeutic intervention, often results in psycho-social healing.Therapy''s Delusions, The Myth of the Unconscious and the Exploitation of Today''s Walking Worried by Ethan Watters & Richard Ofshe\u000apublished by Scribner, New York, 1999  Social contact with others is universally seen as beneficial for all humans and regularly scheduled visits with anyone would be likely to diminish both mild and severe emotional difficulty.Many resources available to a person experiencing emotional distress\u2014the friendly support of friends, peers, family members, clergy contacts, personal reading, healthy exercise, research, and independent coping\u2014all present considerable value. Critics note that humans have been dealing with crises, navigating severe social problems and finding solutions to life problems long before the advent of psychotherapy.F\u00fcredi, F. (2003) Therapy Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Uncertain Age: Routledge, (ISBN 0-415-32159-X) Of course, it may well be something in the patient that does not develop these "natural" supports that requires therapy.Further critiques have emerged from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these is the issue of power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded\u2014both inside and outside the consulting room\u2014to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealise the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relation. It is also fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified. So, while it is seldom intended, the therapist-client relationship always participates in society''s power relations and political dynamics.Guilfoyle, M. (2005).

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(22,0,'{{Sociology}}Sociology emerged from enlightenment thought, shortly after the French Revolution, as a positivist science of society. Its genesis owed to various key movements in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of knowledge. Social analysis in a broader sense, however, has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and necessarily pre-dates the field. Modern academic sociology arose as a reaction to modernity, capitalism, urbanization, rationalization, and secularization, bearing a particularly strong interest in the emergence of the modern nation state; its constituent institutions, its units of socialization, and its means of surveillance. An emphasis on the concept of modernity, rather than the Enlightenment, often distinguishes sociological discourse from that of classical political philosophy.Harriss, John. The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century in Allen, T. and Thomas, Alan (eds) Poverty and Development in the 21st Century'', Oxford University Press, Oxford. p325.Within a relatively brief period of time the discipline greatly expanded and diverged, both topically and methodologically, particularly as a result of myriad reactions against empiricism. Historical debates are broadly marked by theoretical disputes over the primacy of either structure or agency. Contemporary social theory has tended toward the attempt to reconcile these dilemmas. Whilst postmodernist trends in recent years have seen a rise in highly abstracted theory, new quantitative data collection methods have also emerged, and remain common tools for governments, businesses and organizations. Social research sprang from sociology, but has since gained a degree of autonomy as practitioners from other disciplines share its purpose. Similarly, "social science" has come to be appropriated as an umbrella term to refer to various disciplines which study society or human culture.\u000aPrecursors\u000aAncient timesSociological reasoning may be traced back at least as far as the ancient Greeks (cf. Xenophanes\u2032 remark: "If horses would adore gods, these gods would resemble horses"). Proto- sociological observations are to be found in the founding texts of Western philosophy (Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Polybius and so on), as well as in the non-European thought of figures such as Confucius.{{cite book}} The characteristic trends in the sociological thinking of the ancient Greeks can be traced back to the social environment.  Because there was rarely any extensive or highly centralized political organization within states this allowed the tribal spirit of localism and provincialism to have free play.  This tribal spirit of localism and provincialism pervaded most of the Greek thinking upon social phenomena.{{cite book}} The origin of the survey can be traced back to the Doomesday Book ordered by king William I in 1086.A. H. Halsey(2004),A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society,p.34Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell(1970),A new dictionary of sociology,p.201\u000aThere is evidence of early Muslim sociology from the 14th century. Ibn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), in his Muqaddimah (later translated as Prolegomena in Latin), the introduction to a seven volume analysis of universal history, was the first to advance social philosophy and social science in formulating theories of social cohesion and social conflict. He is thus considered by some to be the forerunner of sociology.H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", Cooperation South Journal 1.Dr. S. W. Akhtar (1997).

(from the Latin: socius, "companion"; and the suffix -ology, "the study of", from Greek \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, l\u00f3gos, "knowledge" "Comte, Auguste" A Dictionary of Sociology (3rd Ed), John Scott & Gordon Marshall (eds), Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0198609868, ISBN 978-0198609865"Sociology" in Dictionary of the Social Sciences, Craig Calhoun (ed), Oxford University Press, 2002, ISBN 0195123719, ISBN 978-0195123715).The term was independently re-invented, and introduced as a neologism, by the French thinker Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857) in 1838.A Dictionary of Sociology, Article: Comte, Auguste Comte had earlier expressed his work as "social physics", but that term had been appropriated by others, most notably a Belgian statistician, Adolphe Quetelet (1796\u20131874). Writing after the original enlightenment political philosophers of social contract, Comte hoped to unify all studies of humankind through the scientific understanding of the social realm. His own sociological scheme was typical of the 19th century humanists; he believed all human life passed through distinct historical stages and that, if one could grasp this progress, one could prescribe the remedies for social ills. Sociology was to be the "queen science" in Comte''s schema; all basic physical sciences had to arrive first, leading to the most fundamentally difficult science of human society itself. Comte has thus come to be viewed as the "Father of Sociology". Comte delineated his broader philosophy of science in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830-1842], whereas his A General View of Positivism (1865) emphasised the particular goals of sociology.\u000aIn later life, Comte developed a ''religion of humanity'' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the ''positivist calendar''. For close associate John Stuart Mill, it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the Course in Positive Philosophy) and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious system).http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte The system was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwin''s On the Origin of Species to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte''s English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour altrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "altruism")."Comte''s secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the Nouveau Grand-\u00catre Supr\u00eame (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the Grand F\u00e9tish (the Earth) and the Grand Milieu (Destiny)"  According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte''s austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with no where to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.\u000a\u000aComte''s account of social evolution bears similarity to Karl Marx''s (1818\u20131883) view that human society would progress toward a communist peak. This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early Utopian socialist, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760\u20131825), who was at one time Comte''s mentor. Both thinkers intended to develop a new scientific ideology in the wake of European secularisation. Marx, in the tradition of Hegelianism, rejected the positivist method, but in attempting to develop a science of society nevertheless became recognized as a founder of sociology later as the word gained wider meaning. Isaiah Berlin described Marx as the "true father" of modern sociology, "in so far as anyone can claim the title."Berlin, Isaiah. 1967. Karl Marx. Time Inc Book Division, New York. pp130{{Quotation}}The early sociology of Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms. (Spencer was in actual fact a proponent of Lamarckism rather than Darwinism).\u000aOther precursorsMany other philosophers and academics were influential in the development of sociology, not least the Enlightenment theorists of social contract, and historians such as Adam Ferguson (1723\u20131816). For his theory on social interaction, Ferguson has himself been described as "the father of modern sociology"{{Cite book}} Other early works to appropriate the term ''sociology'' included A Treatise on Sociology, Theoretical and Practical by the North American lawyer Henry Hughes and Sociology for the South, or the Failure of Free SocietySociology For The South Or The Failure of Free Society by the American lawyer George Fitzhugh. Both books were published in 1854, in the context of the debate over slavery in the antebellum US. The Study of Sociology by the English philosopher Herbert Spencer appeared in 1874. Lester Frank Ward, described by some as the father of American sociology, published Dynamic Sociology in 1883. Harriet Martineau, a Whig social theorist and the English translator of many of Comte''s works, has been cited as the first female sociologist. Various other early social historians and economists have gained recognition as classical sociologists, perhaps most notably Robert Michels (1876\u20131936), Alexis de Tocqueville (1805\u20131859), Vilfredo Pareto (1848\u20131923) and Thorstein Veblen (1857\u20131926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from political philosophy in the attempt to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or dialectical, rather than purely moral, normative or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.\u000aFoundation of the academic discipline\u000aClassical theorists of sociology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838\u20131909), Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies (1855\u20131936), \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917), Georg Simmel (1858\u20131918), Max Weber (1864\u20131920), and Karl Mannheim (1893\u20131947). Many of these figures did not consider themselves strictly ''sociologists'' and regularly contributed to jurisprudence, economics, psychology, and general philosophy. Formal academic sociology began when Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method. In 1896, he established the journal L''Ann\u00e9e Sociologique. Durkheim''s seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations, distinguished sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the concept of structural functionalism.Gianfranco Poggi (2000). Durkheim. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 1.A course entitled "sociology" was in the United States taught under its own name for the first time in 1875 by William Graham Sumner, drawing upon the thought of Comte and Herbert Spencer rather than the work Durkheim was advancing in Europe.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O119-Sociology.html In 1890, the oldest continuing sociology course in the United States began at the University of Kansas, lectured by Frank Blackmar. The Department of History and Sociology at the University of Kansas was established in 1891 About Us - Sociology department,KU News Release, and the first full fledged independent university department of sociology was established in 1892 at the University of Chicago by Albion W. Small (1854\u20131926), who in 1895 founded the American Journal of Sociology.University of Chicago Press - Cookie absent American sociology arose on a broadly independent trajectory to European sociology. George Herbert Mead and Charles H. Cooley were influential in the development of symbolic interactionism and social psychology at the University of Chicago, whilst Lester Ward emphasised the central importance of the scientific method with the publication of Dynamic Sociology in 1883.The first sociology department in the United Kingdom was founded at the London School of Economics in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by Max Weber, who had established a new antipositivist sociology. In 1920 a department was set up in Poland by Florian Znaniecki (1882\u20131958). The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the ''Frankfurt School'' of critical theory) was founded in 1923."Frankfurt School". (2009). In Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Retrieved September 12, 2009, from Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online (Retrieved September 12, 2009) Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after WW2, influencing literary theory and the ''Birmingham School'' of cultural studies.International cooperation in sociology began in 1893 when Rene Worms (1869\u20131926) founded the small Institut International de Sociologie, eclipsed by much larger International Sociological Association from 1949. In 1905 the American Sociological Association, the world''s largest association of professional sociologists, was founded, and Lester F. Ward was selected to serve as the first President of the new society.\u000aThe canon: Durkheim, Marx, WeberDurkheim, Marx, and Weber are typically cited as the three principal architects of modern social science. The sociological "canon of classics" with Durkheim and Weber at the top owes in part to Talcott Parsons, who is largely credited with introducing both to American audiences.Camic, Charles. 1992. "Reputation and Predecessor Selection: Parsons and the Institutionalists", American Sociological Review, Vol. 57, No. 4 (Aug., 1992), pp. 421-445 Parsons'' "Structure of Social Action" (1937) consolidated the American sociological tradition and set the agenda for American sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth. In Parsons'' canon, however, Vilfredo Pareto holds greater significance than either Marx or Simmel. These choices reflected Parsons'' opposition to atheoretical empiricism on the one hand, and to theoretical pluralism on the other.  His canon was thus guided by a desire to "unify the divergent theoretical traditions in sociology behind a single theoretical scheme, one that could in fact be justified by purely scientific developments in the discipline during the previous half century."Levine, Donald.  1991.  "Simmel and Parsons Reconsidered". The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 96, No. 5 (Mar., 1991), pp. 1097-1116 Whilst the secondary role Marx plays in early American sociology may be attributed Parsons, as well as broader political trendshttp://www.jstor.org/pss/3083237/ Burawoy, Michael: The Resurgence of Marxism in American Sociology, the dominance of Marxism in European sociological thought had long since secured the rank of Marx alongside Durkheim and Weber as one of the three "classical" sociologists.Morrison, Ken. 2006 (2nd ed.) "Marx, Durkheim, Weber", Sage, pp. 1-7\u000a19th Century: From positivism to antipositivism\u000aThe methodological approach toward sociology by early theorists was to treat the discipline in broadly the same manner as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method was sought to provide an incontestable foundation for any sociological claims or findings, and to distinguish sociology from less empirical fields such as philosophy. This perspective, called positivism, is based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can come only from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific and quantitative methods. \u00c9mile Durkheim was a major proponent of theoretically grounded empirical research,{{cite book}} seeking correlations to reveal structural laws, or "social facts".  For him, sociology could be described as the "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning".Durkheim, \u00c9mile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45 Durkheim endeavoured to apply sociological findings in the pursuit of political reform and social solidarity.  Today, scholarly accounts of Durkheim''s positivism may be vulnerable to exaggeration and oversimplification: Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in the same way as noble science, whereas Durkheim acknowledged in greater detail the fundamental epistemological limitations.{{cite book}}Fish, Jonathan S. 2005. ''Defending the Durkheimian Tradition. Religion, Emotion and Morality'' Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing.\u000a{{histOfScience}}\u000aReactions against positivism began when German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.{{cite book}} Karl Marx''s methodology borrowed from Hegel dialecticism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of "facts" with the elimination of illusions.{{cite book}} He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Marx nonetheless endeavoured to produce a science of society grounded in the economic determinism of historical materialism. Other philosophers, including Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911) and Heinrich Rickert (1863\u20131936) argued that the natural world differs from the social world because of those unique aspects of human society (meanings, signs, and so on) which inform human cultures.At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms, values, symbols, and social processes viewed from a subjective perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a ''science'' as it is able to identify causal relationships&mdash;especially among ideal types, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.{{cite book}} As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"{{cite book}} as those pursued by natural scientists. Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies presented Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (lit. community and society) as the two normal types of human association. T\u00f6nnies drew a sharp line between the realm of conceptuality and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (''pure'' sociology), whereas the second empirically and in an inductive way (''applied'' sociology). Both Weber and Georg Simmel pioneered the Verstehen (or ''interpretative'') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point-of-view. Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the phenomenological and existential writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.Levine, Donald (ed) ''Simmel: On individuality and social forms'' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix. His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian critique of the limits of perception, asking ''What is society?'' in a direct allusion to Kant''s question ''What is nature?''Levine, Donald (ed) ''Simmel: On individuality and social forms'' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.\u000a20th Century: Critical theory, postmodernism, and positivist revivalIn the early 20th century, sociology expanded in the U.S., including developments in both macrosociology, concerned with the evolution of societies, and microsociology, concerned with everyday human social interactions. Based on the pragmatic social psychology of George Herbert Mead (1863\u20131931), Herbert Blumer (1900\u20131987) and, later, the Chicago school, sociologists developed symbolic interactionism.The Mead Project In the 1920s, Georg Luk\u00e1cs released History and Class Consciousness (1923), whilst a number of works by Durkheim and Weber were published posthumously. In the 1930s, Talcott Parsons (1902\u20131979) developed action theory, integrating the study of social order with the structural and voluntaristic aspects of macro and micro factors, while placing the discussion within a higher explanatory context of system theory and cybernetics. In Austria and later the U.S., Alfred Sch\u00fctz (1899\u20131959) developed social phenomenology, which would later inform social constructionism. During the same period members of the Frankfurt school, such as Theodor W. Adorno (1903\u20131969) and Max Horkheimer (1895\u20131973), developed critical theory, integrating the historical materialistic elements of Marxism with the insights of Weber, Freud and Gramsci &mdash;in theory, if not always in name&mdash; often characterizing capitalist modernity as a move away from the central tenets of enlightenment.During the Interwar period, sociology was undermined by totalitarian governments for reasons of ostensible political control. After the Russian Revolution, sociology was gradually "politicized, Bolshevisized and eventually, Stalinized" until it virtually ceased to exist in the Soviet Union.Elizabeth Ann Weinberg, The Development of Sociology in the Soviet Union, Taylor & Francis, 1974, ISBN 0710078765, Google Print, p.8-9 In China, the discipline was banned with semiotics, comparative linguistics and cybernetics as "Bourgeois pseudoscience" in 1952, not to return until 1979.Xiaogang Wu, Between Public and Professional: Chinese Sociology and the Construction of a Harmonious Society, ASA Footnotes, May-June 2009 Issue \u2022 Volume 37 \u2022 Issue 5 During the same period, however, sociology was also undermined by conservative universities in the West. This was due, in part, to perceptions of the subject as possessing an inherent tendency, through its own aims and remit, toward liberal or left wing thought. Given that the subject was founded by structural functionalists; concerned with organic cohesion and social solidarity, this view was somewhat groundless (though it was Parsons who had introduced Durkheim to American audiences, and his interpretation has been criticized for a latent conservatism).In the mid-20th century there was a general&mdash;but not universal&mdash;trend for U.S.-American sociology to be more scientific in nature, due to the prominence at that time of action theory and other system-theoretical approaches. Robert K. Merton released his Social Theory and Social Structure (1949). By the turn of the 1960s, sociological research was increasingly employed as a tool by governments and businesses worldwide. Sociologists developed new types of quantitative and qualitative research methods. In 1959, Erving Goffman published The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, whilst C. Wright Mills presented The Sociological Imagination, encouraging humanistic discourse and a rejection of abstracted empiricism and grand theory. Parallel with the rise of various social movements in the 1960s, particularly in Britain, the cultural turn saw a rise in conflict theories emphasizing social struggle, such as neo-Marxism and second-wave feminism.Haralambos & Holborn. ''Sociology: Themes and perspectives'' (2004) 6th ed, Collins Educational. ISBN 978-0-00-715447-0. Ralf Dahrendorf and Ralph Miliband presented pioneering theory on class conflict and industrialized nation statess. The sociology of religion saw a renaissance in the decade with new debates on secularisation thesis, globalization, and the very definition of religious practise. Theorists such as Lenski and Yinger formulated ''functional'' definitions of religion; enquiring as to what a religion does rather than what it is in familiar terms. Thus, various new social institutions and movements could be examined for their religious role. Marxist theorists continued to scrutize consumerism and capitalist ideology in analogous terms. Antonio Gramsci''s Selections from the Prison Notebooks [1929-1935] was finally published in English during the early 1970s.http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/books/archive/prison_notebooks.htmlIn the 1960s and 1970s so-called post-structuralist and postmodernist theory, drawing upon structuralism and phenomenology as much as classical social science, made a considerable impact on frames of sociological enquiry. Often understood simply as a cultural style ''after-Modernism'' marked by intertextuality, pastiche and irony, sociological analyses of postmodernity have presented a distinct era relating to (1) the dissolution of metanarratives (particularly in the work of Lyotard), and (2) commodity fetishism and the ''mirroring'' of identity with consumption in late capitalist society (Debord; Baudrillard; Jameson).''Cultural Studies: Theory and Practise''. By: Barker, Chris. Sage Publications, 2005. p446. Postmodernism has also been associated with the rejection of enlightenment conceptions of the human subject by thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and, to a lesser extent, in Louis Althusser''s attempt to reconcile Marxism with anti-humanism. Most theorists associated with the movement actively refused the label, preferring to accept postmodernity as a historical phenomenon rather than a method of analysis, if at all. Nevertheless, self-consciously postmodern pieces continue to emerge within the social and political sciences in general.\u000aIn the 1980s, theorists outside of France tended to focus on globalization, communication, and reflexivity in terms of a ''second'' phase of modernity, rather than a distinct new era per se. J\u00fcrgen Habermas established communicative action as a reaction to postmodern challenges to the discourse of modernity, informed both by critical theory and American pragmatism. Fellow German sociologist, Ulrich Beck, presented The Risk Society (1992) as an account of the manner in which the modern nation state has become organized. In Britain, Anthony Giddens set out to reconcile recurrent theoretical dichotomies through structuration theory. During the 1990s, Giddens developed work on the challenges of "high modernity", as well as a new ''third way'' politics that would greatly influence New Labour in U.K. and the Clinton administration in the U.S. Leading Polish sociologist, Zygmunt Bauman, wrote extensively on the concepts of modernity and postmodernity, particularly with regard to the Holocaust and consumerism as historical phenomena.Bauman, Zygmunt. Postmodernity and its discontents. New York: New York University Press. 1997. ISBN 0-7456-1791-3 Whilst Pierre Bourdieu gained significant critical acclaim for his continued work on cultural capital,Bourdieu The Guardian obituary, Douglas Johnson 28 January 2002 certain French sociologists, particularly Jean Baudrillard and Michel Maffesoli, were criticised for perceived obfuscation and relativism.Norris, Christopher.

In 1994, Robert K. Merton won the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the sociology of science.http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html The positivist tradition is popular to this day, particularly in the United States.Positivism in sociological research: USA and UK (1966\u20131990). By: Gartrell, C. David, Gartrell, John W., British Journal of Sociology, 00071315, Dec2002, Vol. 53, Issue 4 The discipline''s two most widely cited American journals, the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review, primarily publish research in the positivist tradition, with ASR exhibiting greater diversity (the British Journal of Sociology, on the other hand, publishes primarily non-positivist articles).  The twentieth century saw improvements to the quantitative methodologies employed in sociology.  The development of longitudinal studies that follow the same population over the course of years or decades enabled researchers to study long-term phenomena and increased the researchers'' ability to infer causality. The increase in the size of data sets produced by the new survey methods was followed by the invention of new statistical techniques for analyzing this data. Analysis of this sort is usually performed with statistical software packages such as SAS, Stata, or SPSS.Social network analysis is an example of a new paradigm in the positivist tradition. The influence of social network analysis is pervasive in many sociological sub fields such as economic sociology (see the work of J. Clyde Mitchell, Harrison White, or Mark Granovetter, for example), organizational behavior, historical sociology, political sociology, or the sociology of education. There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills, and his studies of the Power Elite in the United States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz.{{cite web}}\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a\u000aTimeline of sociology\u000aList of sociologists\u000aSubfields of sociology\u000aList of sociology topics\u000aPhilosophy of social science\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000a\u000aGerhard Lensky. 1982.

ISBN 0-17-490058-9 In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.The field is often considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer. In the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on psychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed after the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in the number of trained clinicians. Since that time, two main educational models have developed\u2014the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (focusing on research) and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical practice). Clinical psychologists are now considered experts in providing psychotherapy, and generally train within four primary theoretical orientations\u2014psychodynamic, humanistic, behavior therapy/ cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.\u000aHistory{{main}} {{see}}\u000a\u000aAlthough modern, scientific psychology is often dated at the 1879 opening of the first psychological laboratory by Wilhelm Wundt, attempts to create methods for assessing and treating mental distress existed long before. The earliest recorded approaches were a combination of religious, magical and/or medical perspectives.Benjamin, Ludy. (2007). A Brief History of Modern Psychology. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishing. ISBN 978-1-4051-3206-0 Early examples of such physicians included Pata\u00f1jali, Padmasambhava,T.

Other popular treatments included physiognomy\u2014the study of the shape of the face\u2014and mesmerism, Mesmer''s treatment by the use of magnets.

Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 1, 1\u201330. While the scientific community eventually came to reject all of these methods, academic psychologists also were not concerned with serious forms of mental illness. That area was already being addressed by the developing fields of psychiatry and neurology within the asylum movement. It was not until the end of the 19th century, around the time when Sigmund Freud was first developing his "talking cure" in Vienna, that the first scientifically clinical application of psychology began.\u000aEarly clinical psychology\u000aBy the second half of the 1800s, the scientific study of psychology was becoming well established in university laboratories. Although there were a few scattered voices calling for an applied psychology, the general field looked down upon this idea and insisted on "pure" science as the only respectable practice. This changed when Lightner Witmer (1867\u20131956), a past student of Wundt and head of the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed to treat a young boy who had trouble with spelling. His successful treatment was soon to lead to Witmer''s opening of the first psychological clinic at Penn in 1896, dedicated to helping children with learning disabilities.Alessandri, M., Heiden, L., & Dunbar-Welter, M. (1995). "History and Overview" in Heiden, Lynda & Hersen, Michel (eds.), Introduction to Clinical Psychology. New York : Plenum Press. ISBN 0-306-44877-7 Ten years later in 1907, Witmer was to found the first journal of this new field, The Psychological Clinic, where he coined the term "clinical psychology", defined as "the study of individuals, by observation or experimentation, with the intention of promoting change".Compas, Bruce & Gotlib, Ian. (2002). Introduction to Clinical Psychology. New York, NY : McGraw-Hill Higher Education. ISBN 0-07-012491-4 The field was slow to follow Witmer''s example, but by 1914, there were 26 similar clinics in the U.S.Evans, Rand. (1999). Clinical psychology born and raised in controversy. APA Monitor, 30(11). Even as clinical psychology was growing, working with issues of serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists.Routh, Donald. (1994). Clinical psychology since 1917 : Science, practice, and organization. New York : Plenum Press. ISBN 0-306-44452-6 However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists'' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I with the development of two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. Due in large part to the success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of clinical psychology for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.\u000aEarly professional organizationsThe field began to organize under the name "clinical psychology" in 1917 with the founding of the American Association of Clinical Psychology.  This only lasted until 1919, after which the American Psychological Association (founded by G. Stanley Hall in 1892) developed a section on Clinical Psychology, which offered certification until 1927. Growth in the field was slow for the next few years when various unconnected psychological organizations came together as the American Association of Applied Psychology in 1930, which would act as the primary forum for psychologists until after World War II when the APA reorganized.American Psychological Association. (1999). APA: Uniting psychologists for more than 100 years. APA Monitor Online, 30(11). In 1945, the APA created what is now called Division 12, its division of clinical psychology, which remains a leading organization in the field. Psychological societies and associations in other English-speaking countries developed similar divisions, including in Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\u000aWorld War II and the integration of treatment\u000aWhen World War II broke out, the military once again called upon clinical psychologists. As soldiers began to return from combat, psychologists started to notice symptoms of psychological trauma labeled "shell shock" (eventually to be termed posttraumatic stress disorder) that were best treated as soon as possible. Because physicians (including psychiatrists) were over-extended in treating bodily injuries, psychologists were called to help treat this condition.Reisman, John. (1991). A History of Clinical Psychology. UK : Taylor Francis. ISBN 1-56032-188-1 At the same time, female psychologists (who were excluded from the war effort) formed the National Council of Women Psychologists with the purpose of helping communities deal with the stresses of war and giving young mothers advice on child rearing. After the war, the Veterans Administration in the U.S. made an enormous investment to set up programs to train doctoral-level clinical psychologists to help treat the thousands of veterans needing care. As a consequence, the U.S. went from having no formal university programs in clinical psychology in 1946 to over half of all Ph.D.s in psychology in 1950 being awarded in clinical psychology.WWII helped bring dramatic changes to clinical psychology, not just in America but internationally as well. Graduate education in psychology began adding psychotherapy to the science and research focus based on the 1947 scientist-practitioner model, known today as the Boulder Model, for Ph.D. programs in clinical psychology.Routh, Donald. (2000). Clinical Psychology Training: A History of Ideas and Practices Prior to 1946. American Psychologist, 55(2), 236. Clinical psychology in Britain developed much like in the U.S. after WWII, specifically within the context of the National Health ServiceHall, John & Llewelyn, Susan. (2006). What is Clinical Psychology? 4th Edition. UK: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-856689-1 with qualifications, standards, and salaries managed by the British Psychological Society.Henry, David. (1959). Clinical psychology abroad. American Psychologist, 14(9), 601-604.\u000aDevelopment of the Doctor of Psychology degreeBy the 1960s, psychotherapy had become imbedded within clinical psychology, but for many the Ph.D. educational model did not offer the necessary training for those interested in practice rather than research. There was a growing argument that said the field of psychology in the U.S. had developed to a degree warranting explicit training in clinical practice. The concept of a practice-oriented degree was debated in 1965 and narrowly gained approval for a pilot program at the University of Illinois starting in 1968.Murray, Bridget. (2000). The degree that almost wasn''t: The PsyD comes of age. Monitor on Psychology, 31(1). Several other similar programs were instituted soon after, and in 1973, at the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology, the Practitioner-Scholar Model of Clinical Psychology\u2014or Vail Model\u2014resulting in the Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) degree was recognized.Norcross, J. & Castle, P. (2002). Appreciating the Psy.D: The Facts. Eye on Psi Chim, 7(1), 22-26. Although training would continue to include research skills and a scientific understanding of psychology, the intent would be to produce highly trained professionals, similar to programs in medicine, dentistry, and law. The first program explicitly based on the Psy.D. model was instituted at Rutgers University. Today, about half of all American graduate students in clinical psychology are enrolled in Psy.D. programs.\u000aA changing professionSince the 1970s, clinical psychology has continued growing into a robust profession and academic field of study. Although the exact number of practicing clinical psychologists is unknown, it is estimated that between 1974 and 1990, the number in the U.S. grew from 20,000 to 63,000.Menninger, Roy and Nemiah, John. (2000). American psychiatry after World War II: 1944-1994. Washington, D.C. : American Psychiatric Press. ISBN 0-88048-866-2 Clinical psychologists continue to be experts in assessment and psychotherapy while expanding their focus to address issues of gerontology, sports, and the criminal justice system to name a few. One important field is health psychology, the fastest-growing employment setting for clinical psychologists in the past decade. Other major changes include the impact of managed care on mental health care; an increasing realization of the importance of knowledge relating to multicultural and diverse populations; and emerging privileges to prescribe psychotropic medication.\u000aProfessional practiceClinical psychologists can offer a range of professional services, including:\u000a\u000aAdminister and interpret psychological assessment and testing\u000aConduct psychological research\u000aConsultation (especially with schools and businesses)\u000aDevelopment of prevention and treatment programs\u000aProgram administration\u000aProvide expert testimony (forensic psychology)\u000aProvide psychological treatment (psychotherapy)\u000aTeach\u000a\u000aIn practice, clinical psychologists may work with individuals, couples, families, or groups in a variety of settings, including private practices, hospitals, mental health organizations, schools, businesses, and non-profit agencies. Most clinical psychologists who engage in research and teaching do so within a college or university setting. Clinical psychologists may also choose to specialize in a particular field\u2014common areas of specialization, some of which can earn board certification,American Board of Professional Psychology, Specialty Certification in Professional Psychology include:\u000a\u000aChild and adolescent\u000aFamily and relationship counseling\u000aForensic\u000aHealth\u000aNeuropsychological disorders\u000aOrganization and business\u000aSchool\u000aSpecific disorders (e.g. trauma, addiction, eating, sleep, sex, clinical depression, anxiety, or phobias)\u000aSport\u000a\u000a\u000aTraining and certification to practice\u000a{{main}}Clinical psychologists study a generalist program in psychology plus postgraduate training and/or clinical placement and supervision. The length of training differs across the world, ranging from four years plus post-Bachelors supervised practicePathways to register as a psychologist including clinical psychologist in Australia to a doctorate of three to six years which combines clinical placement.APA: About clinical psychology In the USA, about half of all clinical psychology graduate students are being trained in Ph.D. programs\u2014a model that emphasizes research\u2014with the other half in Psy.D. programs, which has more focus on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law). Both models are accredited by the American Psychological AssociationAPA. (2005). Guidelines and Principles for Accreditation of Programs in Professional Psychology: Quick Reference Guide to Doctoral Programs. and many other English-speaking psychological societies. A smaller number of schools offer accredited programs in clinical psychology resulting in a Masters degree, which usually take two to three years post-Bachelors. In the U.K., clinical psychologists undertake a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (D.Clin.Psych.), which is a practitioner doctorate with both clinical and research components. This is a three-year full-time salaried program sponsored by the National Health Service (NHS) and based in universities and the NHS. Entry into these programs is highly competitive, and requires at least a three-year undergraduate degree in psychology plus some form of experience, usually in either the NHS as an Assistant Psychologist or in academia as a Research Assistant. It is not unusual for applicants to apply several times before being accepted onto a training course as only about one-fifth of applicants are accepted each year.Cheshire, K. & Pilgrim, D. (2004). A short introduction to clinical psychology. London; Thousand Oaks, CA : Sage Publications. ISBN 0-7619-4768-X These clinical psychology doctoral degrees are accredited by the British Psychological Society and the Health Professions Council (HPC). The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the UK. Those who successfully complete clinical psychology doctoral degrees are eligible to apply for registration with the HPC as a clinical psychologist. The practice of clinical psychology requires a license in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. Although each of the U.S. states is somewhat different in terms of requirements and licenses, there are three common elements:{{cite web}}\u000a\u000aGraduation from an accredited school with the appropriate degree\u000aCompletion of supervised clinical experience or internship\u000aPassing a written examination and, in some states, an oral examination\u000a\u000aAll U.S. state and Canadian province licensing boards are members of the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) which created and maintains the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). Many states require other examinations in addition to the EPPP, such as a jurisprudence (i.e. mental health law) examination and/or an oral examination. Most states also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year in order to renew a license, which can be obtained though various means, such as taking audited classes and attending approved workshops. Clinical psychologists require the Psychologist license to practice, although licenses can be obtained with a masters-level degree, such as Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), and Licensed Psychological Associate (LPA).{{cite web}}In the U.K. registration as a clinical psychologist with the Health Professions Council (HPC) is necessary. The HPC is the statutory regulator for practitioner psychologists in the U.K. In the U.K. the following titles are restricted by law "registered psychologist" and "practitioner psychologist"; in addition the specialist title "clinical psychologist" is also restricted by law.\u000aAssessment\u000aAn important area of expertise for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and there are indications that as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice.Groth-Marnat, G. (2003). Handbook of Psychological Assessment, 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ : John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 0-471-41979-6 Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological or behavioral problems. As such, the results of such assessments are usually used to create generalized impressions (rather than diagnoses) in service to informing treatment planning. Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.  There exist literally hundreds of various assessment tools, although only a few have been shown to have both high validity (i.e., test actually measures what it claims to measure) and reliability (i.e., consistency). These measures generally fall within one of several categories, including the following:\u000a\u000aIntelligence & achievement tests \u2013 These tests are designed to measure certain specific kinds of cognitive functioning (often referred to as IQ) in comparison to a norming-group. These tests, such as the WISC-IV, attempt to measure such traits as general knowledge, verbal skill, memory, attention span, logical reasoning, and visual/spatial perception. Several tests have been shown to predict accurately certain kinds of performance, especially scholastic.\u000aPersonality tests \u2013 Tests of personality aim to describe patterns of behavior, thoughts, and feelings. They generally fall within two categories: objective and projective. Objective measures, such as the MMPI, are based on restricted answers\u2014such as yes/no, true/false, or a rating scale\u2014which allow for computation of scores that can be compared to a normative group. Projective tests, such as the Rorschach inkblot test, allow for open-ended answers, often based on ambiguous stimuli, presumably revealing non-conscious psychological dynamics.\u000aNeuropsychological tests \u2013 Neuropsychological tests consist of specifically designed tasks used to measure psychological functions known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. They are typically used to assess impairment after an injury or illness known to affect neurocognitive functioning, or when used in research, to contrast neuropsychological abilities across experimental groups. \u000aClinical observation \u2013 Clinical psychologists are also trained to gather data by observing behavior. The clinical interview is a vital part of assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.\u000a\u000a\u000aDiagnostic impressions{{Seealso}}\u000aAfter assessment, clinical psychologists often provide a diagnostic impression. Many countries use the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) while the U.S. most often uses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM version IV-TR). Both assume medical concepts and terms, and state that there are categorical disorders that can be diagnosed by set lists of descriptive criteria.Jablensky, Assen. (2005). Categories, dimensions and prototypes: Critical issues for psychiatric classification. Psychopathology, 38(4), 201 Several new models are being discussed, including a "dimensional model" based on empirically validated models of human differences (such as the five factor model of personalityWidiger, Thomas & Trull, Timothy. (2007). Plate tectonics in the classification of personality disorder: shifting to a dimensional model. American Psychologist, 62(2), 71-83.) and a "psychosocial model", which would take changing, intersubjective states into greater account.Mundt, Christoph & Backenstrass, Matthias. (2005). Psychotherapy and classification: Psychological, psychodynamic, and cognitive aspects. Psychopathology, 38(4), 219 The proponents of these models claim that they would offer greater diagnostic flexibility and clinical utility without depending on the medical concept of illness. However, they also admit that these models are not yet robust enough to gain widespread use, and should continue to be developed.Some clinical psychologists do not tend to diagnose, but rather use formulation\u2014an individualized map of the difficulties that the patient or client faces, encompassing predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating (maintaining) factors.Kinderman, P. and Lobban, F. (2000) Evolving formulations: Sharing complex information with clients. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 28(3), 307-310\u000aClinical theories and interventions\u000a{{main}}\u000aPsychotherapy involves a formal relationship between professional and client\u2014usually an individual, couple, family, or small group\u2014that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.Clinicians have a wide range of individual interventions to draw from, often guided by their training\u2014for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although there are literally dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.\u000a\u000aInsight \u2013 emphasis is on gaining greater understanding of the motivations underlying one&#39;s thoughts and feelings (e.g. psychodynamic therapy)\u000aAction \u2013 focus is on making changes in how one thinks and acts (e.g. solution focused therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy)\u000aIn-session \u2013 interventions center on the here-and-now interaction between client and therapist (e.g. humanistic therapy, Gestalt therapy)\u000aOut-session \u2013 a large portion of therapeutic work is intended to happen outside of session (e.g. bibliotherapy, rational emotive behavior therapy)\u000a\u000a The methods used are also different in regards to the population being served as well as the context and nature of the problem. Therapy will look very different between, say, a traumatized child, a depressed but high-functioning adult, a group of people recovering from substance dependence, and a ward of the state suffering from terrifying delusions. Other elements that play a critical role in the process of psychotherapy include the environment, culture, age, cognitive functioning, motivation, and duration (i.e. brief or long-term therapy).La Roche, Martin. (2005). The cultural context and the psychotherapeutic process: Toward a culturally sensitive psychotherapy. Journal of Psychotherapy Integration, 15(2), 169\u2013185\u000aFour main schoolsThe field is dominated in terms of training and practice by essentially four major schools of practice: psychodynamic, humanistic, behavioral/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy.\u000aPsychodynamic{{main}}\u000aThe psychodynamic perspective developed out of the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud. The core object of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious\u2014to make the client aware of his or her own primal drives (namely those relating to sex and aggression) and the various defenses used to keep them in check.Gabbard, Glen. (2005). Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice, 4th Ed. Washington, DC : American Psychiatric Press. ISBN 1-58562-185-4 The essential tools of the psychoanalytic process are the use of free association and an examination of the client''s transference towards the therapist, defined as the tendency to take unconscious thoughts or emotions about a significant person (e.g. a parent) and "transfer" them onto another person. Major variations on Freudian psychoanalysis practiced today include self psychology, ego psychology, and object relations theory. These general orientations now fall under the umbrella term psychodynamic psychology, with common themes including examination of transference and defenses, an appreciation of the power of the unconscious, and a focus on how early developments in childhood have shaped the client''s current psychological state.\u000aHumanistic{{main}}\u000aHumanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, largely due to the person-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (often referred to as Rogerian Therapy) and existential psychology developed by Victor Frankl and Rollo May. Rogers believed that a client needed only three things from a clinician to experience therapeutic improvement\u2014congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding.McMillan, Michael. (2004). The Person-Centred Approach to Therapeutic Change. London, Thousand Oaks : SAGE Publications. ISBN 0-7619-4868-6 By using phenomenology, intersubjectivity and first-person categories, the humanistic approach seeks to get a glimpse of the whole person and not just the fragmented parts of the personality.Rowan, John. (2001). Ordinary Ecstasy : The Dialectics of Humanistic Psychology. London, UK : Brunner-Routledge. ISBN 0-415-23633-9 This aspect of holism links up with another common aim of humanistic practice in clinical psychology, which is to seek an integration of the whole person, also called self-actualization. According to humanistic thinking,Schneider, K., Bugental, J., & Pierson, J. (2001). The handbook of humanistic psychology : leading edges in theory, research, and practice, 2nd ed. Thousand Oaks, CA : Sage Publications. ISBN 978-0-7619-2121-9 each individual person already has inbuilt potentials and resources that might help them to build a stronger personality and self-concept. The mission of the humanistic psychologist is to help the individual employ these resources via the therapeutic relationship.\u000aBehavioral and Cognitive behavioral{{main}}\u000a{{main}}Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) developed from the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT is based on the theory that how we think (cognition), how we feel (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being.Beck, A., Davis, D., and Freeman, A. (2007). Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders, 2nd Ed. New York : Guilford Press. ISBN 978-1-59385-476-8 There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies. (2006). Albert Ellis is often referred as the "grandfather" of CBT for his influential work in this field. What is CBT?. Retrieved 03-04-2007.Behavior therapy is a rich tradition. It is well researched with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict the way we think and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior descreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA''s list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning.{{cite journal}} Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong fucos in the school system. In addition, multiple intervention programs have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, Acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and Behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.\u000aSystems or family therapy{{main}}\u000aSystems or family therapy works with couples and families, and emphasizes family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. The central focus tends to be on interpersonal dynamics, especially in terms of how change in one person will affect the entire system.Bitter, J. & Corey, G. (2001). "Family Systems Therapy" in Gerald Corey (ed.), Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy. Belmost, CA : Brooks/Cole. Therapy is therefore conducted with as many significant members of the "system" as possible. Goals can include improving communication, establishing healthy roles, creating alternative narratives, and addressing problematic behaviors. Contributors include John Gottman, Jay Haley, Sue Johnson, and Virginia Satir.\u000aOther major therapeutic orientations{{seealso}}\u000aThere exist dozens of recognized schools or orientations of psychotherapy\u2014the list below represents a few influential orientations not given above. Although they all have some typical set of techniques practitioners employ, they are generally better known for providing a framework of theory and philosophy that guides a therapist in his or her working with a client.\u000a\u000aExistential \u2013 Existential psychotherapy postulates that people are largely free to choose who we are and how we interpret and interact with the world. It intends to help the client find deeper meaning in life and to accept responsibility for living. As such, it addresses fundamental issues of life, such as death, aloneness, and freedom. The therapist emphasizes the client\u2019s ability to be self-aware, freely make choices in the present, establish personal identity and social relationships, create meaning, and cope with the natural anxiety of living.Van Deurzen, Emmy. (2002). Existential Counseling & Psychotherapy in Practice. London; Thousand Oaks : Sage Publications. ISBN 0-7619-6223-9 Important writers in existential therapy include Rollo May, Victor Frankl, James Bugental, and Irvin Yalom.One influential therapy that came out of Existential therapy is Gestalt therapy, primarily founded by Fritz Perls in the 1950s. It is well-known for techniques designed to increase various kinds of self-awareness\u2014the best-known perhaps being the "empty chair technique"\u2014which are generally intended to explore resistance to "authentic contact", resolve internal conflicts, and help the client complete "unfinished business".Woldt, Ansel and Toman, Sarah. (2005). Gestalt Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice. Thousand Oaks, CA. : Sage Publications. ISBN 0-7619-2791-3\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPostmodern \u2013 Postmodern psychology says that the experience of reality is a subjective construction built upon language, social context, and history, with no essential truths.Slife, B., Barlow, S. and Williams, R. (2001). Critical issues in psychotherapy : translating new ideas into practice. London : SAGE. ISBN 0-7619-2080-3 Since &#34;mental illness&#34; and &#34;mental health&#34; are not recognized as objective, definable realities, the postmodern psychologist instead sees the goal of therapy strictly as something constructed by the client and therapist.Blatner, Adam. (1997). The Implications of Postmodernism for Psychotherapy. Individual Psychology, 53(4), 476-482. Forms of postmodern psychotherapy include narrative therapy, solution-focused therapy, and coherence therapy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTranspersonal \u2013 The transpersonal perspective places a stronger focus on the spiritual facet of human experience.Boorstein, Seymour. (1996). Transpersonal Psychotherapy. Albany : State University of New York Press. ISBN 0-7914-2835-4 It is not a set of techniques so much as a willingness to help a client explore spirituality and/or transcendent states of consciousness. It also is concerned with helping clients achieve their highest potential. Important writers in this area include Ken Wilber, Abraham Maslow, Stanislav Grof, John Welwood, David Brazier and Roberto Assagioli.\u000a\u000a\u000aOther perspectives\u000a\u000aMulticulturalism \u2013 Although the theoretical foundations of psychology are rooted in European culture, there is a growing recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures\u2014with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society\u2014and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice.Young, Mark. (2005). Learning the Art of Helping, 3rd ed. Ch. 4, "Helping Someone Who is Different." Upper Saddle River, NJ : Pearson Education. ISBN 0-13-111753-X As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.Price, Michael. (2008). Culture matters: Accounting for clients'' backgrounds and values makes for better treatment. Monitor on Psychology, 39(7), 52-53.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFeminism \u2013 Feminist therapy is an orientation arising from the disparity between the origin of most psychological theories (which have male authors) and the majority of people seeking counseling being female. It focuses on societal, cultural, and political causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.Hill, Marcia and Ballou, Mary. (2005). The foundation and future of feminist therapy. New York : Haworth Press. ISBN 0-7890-0201-9\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPositive psychology \u2013 Positive psychology is the scientific study of human happiness and well-being, which started to gain momentum in 1998 due to the call of Martin Seligman,Seligman, Martin and Csikszentmihalyi, Mihaly. (2000). Positive psychology: An introduction. American Psychologist, 55(1), 5-14. then president of the APA. The history of psychology shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Applied positive psychology&#39;s main focus, therefore, is to increase one&#39;s positive experience of life and ability to flourish by promoting such things as optimism about the future, a sense of flow in the present, and personal traits like courage, perseverance, and altruism.Snyder, C. and Lopez, S. (2001). Handbook of Positive Psychology. New York ; Oxford : Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-513533-4Linley, Alex, et al. (2006). Positive psychology: Past, present, and (possible) future. The Journal of Positive Psychology, 1(1), 3-16. There is now preliminary empirical evidence to show that by promoting Seligman&#39;s three components of happiness\u2014positive emotion (the pleasant life), engagement (the engaged life), and meaning (the meaningful life)\u2014positive therapy can decrease clinical depression.Seligman, M., Rashid, T., & Parks, A. (2006). Positive Psychotherapy. American Psychologist, 61(8), 774-788.\u000a\u000a\u000aIntegration{{main}}\u000aIn the last couple of decades, there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of cultural, gender, spiritual, and sexual-orientation issues. Clinical psychologists are beginning to look at the various strengths and weaknesses of each orientation while also working with related fields, such as neuroscience, genetics, evolutionary biology, and psychopharmacology. The result is a growing practice of eclecticism, with psychologists learning various systems and the most efficacious methods of therapy with the intent to provide the best solution for any given problem.Norcross, John and Goldfried, Marvin. (2005). The Future of Psychotherapy Integration: A Roundtable. Journal of Psychotherapy Integration, 15(4), 392\u000aProfessional ethics{{globalize/USA}}\u000aThe field of clinical psychology in most countries is strongly regulated by a code of ethics. In the U.S., professional ethics are largely defined by the APA Code of Conduct, which is often used by states to define licensing requirements. The APA Code generally sets a higher standard than that which is required by law as it is designed to guide responsible behavior, the protection of clients, and the improvement of individuals, organizations, and society.APA. (2003). Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. Retrieved July 28, 2007. The Code is applicable to all psychologists in both research and applied fields. The APA Code is based on five principles: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence, Fidelity and Responsibility, Integrity, Justice, and Respect for People''s Rights and Dignity. Detailed elements address how to resolve ethical issues, competence, human relations, privacy and confidentiality, advertising, record keeping, fees, training, research, publication, assessment, and therapy.\u000aComparison with other mental health professions\u000a\u000aSee also: Mental health professional\u000a\u000a\u000aPsychiatry\u000aAlthough clinical psychologists and psychiatrists can be said to share a same fundamental aim\u2014the alleviation of mental distress\u2014their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licenced physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on psychotropic medications as the chief method of addressing the illnessGraybar, S. & Leonard, L. (2005), American Journal of Psychotherapy, 59(1), 1-19.\u2014although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists and medical psychologists (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning.Clinical psychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a growing movement for psychologists to have limited prescribing privileges.Klusman, Lawrence. (2001). Prescribing Psychologists and Patients'' Medical Needs; Lessons From Clinical Psychiatry. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 32(5), 496. These medical privileges require additional training and education. To date, medical psychologists may prescribe psychotropic medications in Guam, New Mexico, and Louisiana and some military psychologist.Halloway, Jennifer. (2004). Gaining prescriptive knowledge. Monitor on Psychology, 35(6). p.22.{{clear}}\u000aCounseling psychology{{Mentalhealthprofessionals}}Counseling psychologists study and use many of the same interventions and tools as clinical psychologists, including psychotherapy and assessment. Traditionally, counseling psychologists help people with what might be considered normal or moderate psychological problems\u2014such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events. Many counseling psychologists also receive specialized training in career assessment, group therapy, and relationship counseling, although some counseling psychologists also work with the more serious problems that clinical psychologists are trained for, such as dementia or psychosis. There are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs than those for clinical psychology and they are more often housed in departments of education rather than psychology. The two professions can be found working in all the same settings but counseling psychologists are more frequently employed in university counseling centers compared to hospitals and private practice for clinical psychologists.Norcross, John. (2000). Clinical versus counseling psychology: What''s the diff? Eye on Psi Chi, 5(1), 20-22. There is considerable overlap between the two fields and distinctions between them continue to fade.\u000aSchool psychologySchool psychologists are primarily concerned with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children and adolescents within a scholastic environment. In the U.K., they are known as "educational psychologists". Like clinical (and counseling) psychologists, school psychologists with doctoral degrees are eligible for licensure as health service psychologists, and many work in private practice. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning. Common degrees include the Educational Specialist Degree (Ed.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), and Doctor of Education (Ed.D.). Traditional job roles for school psychologists employed in school settings have focused mainly on assessment of students to determine their eligibility for special education services in schools, and on consultation with teachers and other school professionals to design and carry out interventions on behalf of students. Other major roles also include offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, designing prevention programs (e.g. for reducing dropout), evaluating school programs, and working with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.Silva, Arlene. (2003). Who Are School Psychologists?. National Association of School Psychologists.American Psychological Association (n.d.). Archival Description of School Psychology. American Psychological Association.\u000aClinical social workSocial workers provide a variety of services, generally concerned with social problems, their causes, and their solutions. With specific training, clinical social workers may also provide psychological counseling (in the U.S. and Canada), in addition to more traditional social work. The Masters in Social Work in the U.S. is a two-year, sixty credit program that includes at least a one year practicum (two years for clinicians).http://www.cswe.org/NR/rdonlyres/111833A0-C4F5-475C-8FEB-EA740FF4D9F1/0/EPAS.pdf\u000aOccupational therapyOccupational therapy\u2014often abbreviated OT\u2014is the "use of productive or creative activity in the treatment or rehabilitation of physically, cognitively, or emotionally disabled people."The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. (2000). "Occupational Therapy." Most commonly, occupational therapists work with people with disabilities to enable them to maximize their skills and abilities. Occupational therapy practitioners are skilled professionals whose education includes the study of human growth and development with specific emphasis on the physical, emotional, psychological, sociocultural, cognitive and environmental components of illness and injury. They commonly work alongside clinical psychologists in settings such as inpatient and outpatient mental health, pain management clinics, eating disorder clinics, and child development services. OT''s use support groups, individual counseling sessions, and activity-based approaches to address psychiatric symptoms and maximize functioning in life activities.\u000aCriticisms and controversiesClinical psychology is a diverse field and there have been recurring tensions over the degree to which clinical practice should be limited to treatments supported by empirical research.Pilgram, D. & Treacher, A. (1992) Clinical Psychology Observed. Routledge: London & USA/Canada. ISBN 0-415-04632-7 Despite some evidence showing that all the major therapeutic orientations are about of equal effectiveness,Leichsenring, Falk & Leibing, Eric. (2003).

The Psychological Record, 55(3), 377-400. there remains much debate about the efficacy of various forms treatment in use in clinical psychology.Lilienfeld, Scott et al. (2002). Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology. New York : Guilford Press. ISBN 1-57230-828-1It has been reported that clinical psychology has rarely allied itself with client groups and tends to individualize problems to the neglect of wider economic, political and social inequality issues that may not be the responsibility of the client. It has been argued that therapeutic practices are inevitably bound up with power inequalities, which can be used for good and bad.Kyuken, W. (1999) Power and clinical psychology: a model for resolving power-related ethical dilemmas. Ethics Behav. 1999;9(1):21-37. A critical psychology movement has argued that clinical psychology, and other professions making up a "psy complex", often fail to consider or address inequalities and power differences and can play a part in the social and moral control of disadvantage, deviance and unrest.Smail, D. Power, Responsibility and Freedom.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(25,0,'{{mergeto}} {{Feminism sidebar}}\u000aFeminist psychology,  is a form of psychology centered on  societal structures, and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm Crawford, M. & Unger, R. (2000). Women and Gender: A feminist psychology (3rd ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.. Feminist psychology is oriented on the values and principles of feminism.  It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. Gender issues can include the way people identify their gender (male, female, transgender), how they have been affected by societal structures related to gender (gender hierarchy), the role of gender in the individual\u2019s life (such as stereotypical gender roles), and any other gender related issues. \u000aThe objective behind this field of study is to understand the individual within the larger social and political aspects of society (Worell & Johnson, 1997). Feminist Psychology puts a strong emphasis on gender equality and women''s rights.\u000aHistory\u000a\u000aFeminist PsychoanalysisThe term feminist psychology was originally coined by Karen Horney (1885-1952), a neo-Freudian psychologist who founded a psychology focused on gender and discovering how gender affected the individual (Horney, 1967). In her book, Feminine Psychology, which is a collection of articles Horney wrote on the subject from 1922-1937, she addresses previously held beliefs about women, relationships, and the effect of society on female psychology. Horney developed this form of psychology specifically in response to Sigmund Freud\u2019s theory of \u201cpenis envy\u201d (Heffner, 2004), which states that women are envious of the male penis and that, during adolescence, women realize that they are lacking a penis. Horney went so far as to counter Freud\u2019s theory of penis envy with the term \u201cwomb envy,\u201d meaning that men were envious of the fact that women could bear children. Because of this biological male inferiority, Horney hypothesized that men therefore attempted to strive for achievement in other aspects of their lives. \u000aHistory in the United StatesThe 1960s was a decade of liberal thinking on many accounts, one being women\u2019s rights and the feminist movement (Kali, 2008).  Naomi Weisstein famously criticized scientific and clinical psychology for having nothing to say about what women are really like, need and want in her 1968 article \u201cPsychology constructs the female.\u201d Since that time, the study of the psychology of women and gender has advanced dramatically, as evidenced in the three major professional journals in feminist psychology: Psychology of Women Quarterly, Sex Roles, and Feminism & Psychology.\u000aFeminist Psychology Organizations\u000aThe AWP or Association for Women in Psychology, was created in 1969 in response to the American Psychological Association\u2019s apparent lack of involvement in the Women\u2019s Liberation MovementThe association for women in psychology. Retrieved April 6, 2010, from  The Association for Women in Psychology Official Website: http://www.awpsych.org/.  The organization formed with the purpose of fighting for and raising awareness of feminist issues within the field of psychology.  The association focused its efforts toward feminist representation in the APA and finally succeed in 1973 with the establishment of APA Division 35. The Society for the Psychology of WomenThe association for women in psychology. Retrieved April 6, 2010, from  The Association for Women in Psychology Official Website: http://www.awpsych.org/.  Today the AWP is active in encouraging the incorporation of feminist practices in psychological theory, research, and activism.  \u000aAPA Division 35, The Society for Psychology of Women, was established in 1973.  It was created to provide a place for all people interested in the psychology of women to access information and resources in the field.  SWP works to incorporate feminist concerns into the teaching and practice of psychology.  Div 35 also runs a number of committees, projects, and programs.\u000aEmotion\u000aA major topic of study within feminist psychology is that of gender differences in emotion.  In general, feminist psychologists view emotion as culturally controlled and state that the differences lie in the expression of emotion rather than the actual experience Brannon, L. (2005). Gender: Psychological perspectives (4th ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc..  The way a person shows his or her emotions is defined by socially enforced display rules which guide the acceptable forms of expression for particular people and feelings Brannon, L. (2005). Gender: Psychological perspectives (4th ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc..Stereotypes of emotion view women as the more emotional sex.  However, feminist psychologists point out that women are only viewed as experiencing passive emotions such as sadness, happiness, fear, and surprise more strongly.  Conversely, men are viewed as more likely to express emotions of a more dominant nature, such as anger Shibley Hyde. J. (2007). Half the human experience: The psychology of women (7th ed.). Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin Company..  Feminist psychologists believe that men and women are socialized throughout their lifetimes to view and express emotions differently.  From infancy mothers use more facial expression when speaking to female babies and use more emotion words in conversation with them as they get older Shibley Hyde. J. (2007). Half the human experience: The psychology of women (7th ed.). Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin Company.Girls and boys are further socialized by peers where girls are rewarded for being sensitive and emotional and boys are rewarded for dominance and lack of most emotional expression Shibley Hyde. J. (2007). Half the human experience: The psychology of women (7th ed.). Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin Company..  Psychologists have also found that women, overall, are more skilled at decoding emotion using non-verbal cues.  These signals include facial expression, tone of voice, and posture Matlin, M. W. (2008). The psychology of women (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth..   Studies have shown gender differences in decoding ability beginning as early as age 3 \u00bd Shibley Hyde. J. (2007). Half the human experience: The psychology of women (7th ed.). Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin Company..\u000aFeminist Therapy\u000aFeminist Therapy is a type of therapy based on viewing women within their sociocultural context.  The main idea behind this therapy is that women''s psychological problems are often a symptom of larger problems in the social structure in which they live.  There is a general agreement that women are more frequently diagnosed with internalizing disorders such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders than men Crawford, M. & Unger, R. (2000). Women and Gender: A feminist psychology (3rd ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc..  Feminist therapists dispute earlier theories that this is a result of psychological weakness in women and instead view it as a result of encountering more stress because of sexist practices in our cultureCrawford, M. & Unger, R. (2000). Women and Gender: A feminist psychology (3rd ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc..The goal of feminist therapy is the empowerment of the client.  Generally, therapists avoid giving specific diagnoses or labels and instead focus on problems within the context of living in a sexist culture.  Clients are given assertiveness training and encouraged to understand their problems with the intent of changing or challenging their circumstancesShibley Hyde. J. (2007). Half the human experience: The psychology of women (7th ed.). Boston MA: Houghton Mifflin Company.. Feminist therapists view lack of power as a major issue in the psychology of women.  Accordingly, the client-therapist relationship is meant to be as egalitarian as possible with both sides communicating on equal ground and sharing experiences Matlin, M. W. (2008). The psychology of women (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth..Feminist therapy is different than nonsexist therapy in that it goes beyond the idea that men and women should be treated equally in the therapeutic relationship.  Feminist therapy incorporates political values while nonsexist therapy does not.  Also, feminist therapy demands social change as well as personal change in order to improve the psychological state of the clientCrawford, M. & Unger, R. (2000). Women and Gender: A feminist psychology (3rd ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc..\u000aFeminist therapists\u000aFeminist therapists often work with clientele who have experienced gender-related trauma such as dating/relationship violence or sexual assault, but feminist psychologists also work with women in search of counseling, as well as men . Feminist therapists are therapists with an interest in gender. Psychologists who have earned their doctoral degree in psychology can then take postdoctoral training in feminist and gender issues . Certainly, psychologists who also identify with the feminism, the belief that women and men are equals, may call themselves feminist psychologists, as these are two identifying qualities about an individual. However, specific postdoctoral training programs hold higher accreditation for the title of feminist psychologists. Currently, there are not many postdoctoral training programs in feminist psychology, but models for this training are being developed and modified for institutions to start offering them (Crawford, 2006). Most of this training is modeled around gender-fair counseling techniques .\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aFeminine psychology\u000a\u000a\u000aExternal linksAWP\u000aAPA Division 35\u000aSWP\u000a\u000aHeffner, C.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(26,0,'Public health is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals." (1920, C.E.A. Winslow)C.-E. A. Winslow, \u201cThe Untilled Fields of Public Health,\u201d Science, n.s. 51 (1920), p. 23  It is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.There are 2 distinct characteristics of public health:1. It deals with preventive rather than curative aspects of health \u000a2. It deals with population-level, rather than individual-level health issuesThe focus of public health intervention is to prevent rather than treat a disease through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors. In addition to these activities, in many cases treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak of an infectious disease. Hand washing, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of public health measures.The goal of public health is to improve lives through the prevention and treatment of disease. The United Nations'' World Health Organization defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."WHO Definition of Health Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, 1946\u000aObjectivesThe focus of a public health intervention is to prevent rather than treat a disease through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors. In addition to these activities, in many cases treating a disease can be vital to preventing its spread to others, such as during an outbreak of infectious disease or contamination of food or water supplies. Vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of public health measures.Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. In the United States, the front line of public health initiatives are state and local health departments. The United States Public Health Service (PHS), led by the Surgeon General of the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Atlanta, are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties.There is a vast discrepancy in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed nations and developing nations. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than USD$10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the federal government spent approximately USD$4,500 per capita in 2000.Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of hand washing can prevent many contagious diseases.http://www.globalhandwashing.org/Publications/Lit_review.htmPublic health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations.The two major postgraduate professional degrees related to this field are the Master of Public Health (MPH) or the (much rarer) Doctor of Public Health (DrPH). Many public health researchers hold PhDs in their fields of speciality, while some public health programs confer the equivalent Doctor of Science degree instead.\u000aHistory of public healthIn some ways, public health is a modern concept, although it has roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of human civilization, it was recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases (theory of miasma). Early religions attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of food eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations. The establishment of governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease and thus ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order.The term "healthy city" used by today''s public health advocates reflects this ongoing challenge to collective physical well-being that results from crowded conditions and urbanization.\u000aEarly public health interventionsBy Roman times, it was well understood that proper diversion of human waste was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by inoculating a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion. This practice was not documented in the West until the early-1700s, and was used on a very limited basis. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s, following the work of Edward Jenner to treat smallpox.During the 14th century Black Death in Europe, it was believed that removing bodies of the dead would further prevent the spread of the bacterial infection. This did little to stem the plague, however, which was most likely spread by rodent-borne fleas. Burning parts of cities resulted in much greater benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period helped mitigate the effects of other infectious diseases. However, according to Michel Foucault, the plague model of governmentality was later controverted by the cholera model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of cemeteries, etc. All those concerns, born of the miasma theory of disease, were mixed with urbanistic concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "biopower". The German conceptualized this in the Polizeiwissenschaft ("Science of police").The science of epidemiology was founded by John Snow''s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory. Although miasma theory correctly teaches that disease is a result of poor sanitation, it was based upon the prevailing theory of spontaneous generation. Germ theory developed slowly: despite Anton van Leeuwenhoek''s observations of Microorganisms, (which are now known to cause many of the most common infectious diseases) in the year 1680, the modern era of public health did not begin until the 1880s, with Louis Pasteur''s germ theory and production of artificial vaccines.Other public health interventions include latrinization, the building of sewers, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a landfill, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. This contribution was made by Edwin Chadwick in 1843 who published a report on the sanitation of the working class population in Great Britain at the time. So began the inception of the modern public health. The industrial revolution had initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories. These settlements were cramped and primitive and there was no organised sanitation. Disease was innevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants....\u000aModern public healthAs the prevalence of infectious diseases in the developed world decreased through the 20th century, public health began to put more focus on chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. An emphasis on physical exercise was reintroduced.{{Citation needed}}In America, public health worker Dr. Sara Josephine Baker lowered the infant mortality rate using preventative methods. She established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy. Dr. Baker led teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of Hell''s Kitchen and taught mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies. After World War I many states and countries followed her example in order to lower infant mortality rates.{{Citation needed}}During the 20th century, the dramatic increase in average life span is widely credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies such as motor-vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning, chlorination of drinking water, smoke-free measures, and programs designed to decrease chronic disease.Meanwhile, the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty. Front-page headlines continue to present society with public health issues on a daily basis: emerging infectious diseases such as SARS, making its way from China (see Public health in China) to Canada and the United States; prescription drug benefits under public programs such as Medicare; the increase of HIV-AIDS among young heterosexual women and its spread in South Africa; the increase of childhood obesity and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the impact of adolescent pregnancy; and the ongoing social, economic and health disasters related to the 2004 Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.{{Citation needed}} These are all ongoing public health challenges.Since the 1980s, the growing field of population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population, rather than advocating for individual behaviour change. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships - these are known as "social determinants of health." A social gradient in health runs through society, with those that are poorest generally suffering the worst health. However even those in the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum.The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health edited by Richard Wilkinson and Michael Marmot, WHO, 2003 The new public health seeks to address these health inequalities by advocating for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.\u000aSchools of public healthIn the US, the Welch-Rose Report of 1915 has been viewed as the basis for the critical movement in the history of the institutional schism between public health and medicine because it led to the establishment of schools of public health supported by the Rockefeller Foundation.Patel, Kant; Rushefsky, Mark E.; and McFarlane, Deborah R. The Politics of Public Health in the United States, M.E. Sharpe, 2005, p. 91. (ISBN 076561135X)Fee and Acheson, A History of education in public health: Health that mocks the doctors'' rules, OUP, 1991. (ISBN 0192617575 ) The report was authored by William Welch, founding dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Wycliffe Rose of the Rockfeller Foundation. The report focused more on research than practical education.Brandt, A. M., and M. Gardner. 2000. Antagonism and Accommodation: Interpreting the Relationship Between Public Health and Medicine in the United States During\u000athe Twentieth Century. American Journal of Public Health 90:707 \u2013 715. Some have blamed the Rockfeller Foundation''s 1916 decision to support the establishment of schools of public health for creating the schism between public health and medicine and legitimizing the rift between medicine''s laboratory investigation of the mechanisms of disease and public health''s nonclinical concern with environmental and social influences on health and wellness.White, K. L. (1991). Healing the schism: Epidemiology, medicine, and the public''s health. New York: Springer-Verlag.Even though schools of public health  had already been established in Europe and North Africa, the US had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions. However, a year following the Welch-Rose report, the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health was founded in 1916. By 1922, schools of public health were established in Columbia, Harvard and Yale universities. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4850.pdfOver the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools had already obtained a medical degree. However, in 1978, 69% of students enrolled in public health schools had only a bachelors degree. Public health school training had evolved from a second degree for medical professionals to a primary public health degree with a focus on the six core disciplines of biostatistics, epidemiology, health services administration, health education, behavioral science and environmental science.\u000aEducation and trainingSchools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.{{cite web}}Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The Master of Public Health (M.P.H.), Doctor of Public Health (Dr.PH.) and the Master of Health Care Administration (M.H.A.) are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms among others. Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health (M.S.P.H.) is granted to students who do extra studies in research, and often have had little health background before entering the degree.Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and preventive medicine who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the Master of Science (M.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), and Doctor of Science (Sc.D.). The doctoral programs are distinct from the M.P.H. and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a dissertation research project.The Association of Schools of Public HealthASPH represents Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) accredited schools of public health in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico.http://www.ceph.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1Delta Omega is the honorary society for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. Currently, there are approximately 50 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.http://www.deltaomega.org/\u000aPublic health programs\u000aToday, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made incredible strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox, a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.An important public health issue facing the world currently is HIV/AIDSEuropean Union Public Health Information System - HIV/Aides page.  Antibiotic resistance is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis.Another major public health concern is diabetesEuropean Union Public Health Information System - Diabetes page. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double.\u000aA controversial aspect of public health is the control of smokingEuropean Union Public Health Information System - Smoking Behaviors page. Non-communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health because it requires a long term strategy for improving unlike the communicable diseases which take a shorter period to be improved. The reason for this is because communicable diseases have been at the top as a global health priority while non communicable diseases have been at the bottom as a global health priority.  The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases. Also, these health problems are heavily framed by private sectors that most of the time benefits from being involved in our global health issues. At the same time, many of these decisions, regarding health problems, are made by industries who emphasize on technological solutions. Governments of all nations need to focus more on proactive solutions rather than relying on private actors to do the job, which they do only to their advantage.{{Cite journal}} Simultaneously, global health policy making is increasingly aligned with industrial and trade policies, and is being done hand in hand with business, thus weakening the firewalls necessary for effective regulation and normative actions both at national and global levels. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers in all developed countries, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting passive (second-hand) smoking and by providing fewer opportunities for smokers to smoke. Opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility (often using the phrase nanny state in the UK), and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall. However, proponents counter that inflicting disease on other people via passive smoking is not a human right, and in fact smokers are still free to smoke in their own homes.There is also a link between public health and veterinary public health which deals with zoonotic diseases, diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(27,0,'{{community}}Community psychology deals with the relationships of the individual to communities and the wider society. Community psychologists seek to understand the quality of life of individuals, communities, and society. Their aim is to enhance quality of life through collaborative research and action.Dalton, J.H., Elias, M.J., & Wandersman, A. (2001). "Community Psychology: Linking Individuals and Communities." Stamford, CT: Wadsworth.Community psychology makes use of various perspectives within and outside of psychology to address issues of communities, the relationships within them, and people''s attitudes about them. Through collaborative research and action, community psychologists (practitioners and researchers) seek to understand and to enhance quality of life for individuals, communities, and society. Rappaport (1977) discusses the perspective of community psychology as an ecological perspective with the person-environment fit being the focus of study and action instead of attempting to change the person or the environment when an individual is seen as having a problem.Rappaport, J. (1977). "Community Psychology: Values, Research, & Action". New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston.  Closely related disciplines include ecological psychology, environmental psychology, cross-cultural psychology, social psychology, political science, public health, sociology, social work, and community development.{{Citation needed}}Community psychology grew out of the community mental health movement, but evolved dramatically as early practitioners incorporated their understandings of political structures and other community contexts into perspectives on client services.Levine, M., & Perkins, D.V. (1997). "Principles of Community Psychology (2nd Ed)". New York: Oxford University Press.\u000a\u000aSociety for Community Research and ActionDivision 27 of the American Psychological Association is the community psychology division of APA, called the Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA). The Society''s mission is as follows:\u000aThe Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA) is an international organization devoted to advancing theory, research, and social action. Its members are committed to promoting health and empowerment and to preventing problems in communities, groups, and individuals. SCRA serves many different disciplines that focus on community research and action.Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA). Division 27 of the American Psychological Association. Retrieved on: February 5, 2008.\u000aThe SCRA website has resources for teaching and learning community psychology, information on events in the field and related to research and action, how to become involved and additional information on the field, members and undergraduate and graduate programs in community psychology.\u000aHistory of community psychology in the USIn the 1950s and 1960s, many factors contributed to the beginning of community psychology in the US. Some of these factors include:\u000a\u000aA shift away from socially conservative, individual-focused practices in health care and psychology into a progressive period concerned with issues of public health, prevention and social change after World War II\u000aThe perceived need of larger-scale mental illness treatment for veterans\u000aPsychologists questioning the value of psychotherapy alone in treating large numbers of people with mental illness\u000aThe development of community mental health centers and deinstitutionalization of people with mental illnesses into their communities\u000a\u000a\u000aSwampscott ConferenceIn 1965, several psychologists met to discuss the future of community mental health as well as discuss the issue of only being involved with problems of mental health instead of the community as a whole. The Swampscott Conference is considered the birthplace of community psychology. A published report on the conference calls for community psychologists to be political activists, agents of social change and "participant-conceptualizers".\u000aTheories, concepts and values in community psychology\u000a\u000aEcological levels of analysisJames Kelly (1966; Trickett, 1984) developed an ecological analogy used to understand the ways in which settings and individuals are interrelated. Unlike the ecological framework developed by Bronfenbrenner (1979), the focus of Kelly''s framework was not so much on how different levels of the environment may impact on the individual, but on understanding how human communities function. Specifically, Kelly suggests that there are 4 important principles that govern people in settings:  \u000a\u000aadaptation: i.e. that what individuals do is adaptive given the demands of the surrounding context\u000asuccession: every setting has a history that created current structures, norms, attitudes, and policies, and any intervention in the setting must appreciate this history and understand why the current system exists in the form that it does\u000acycling of resources: each settings has resources that need to be identified and possibilities for new resources to be developed; a resource perspective emphasizes a focus on strengths of individuals, groups, and institutions within the setting and interventions are more likely to succeed if they build on such existing strengths, rather than introduce new external mechanisms for change\u000ainterdependence: settings are systems, and any change to one aspect of the setting will have consequences for other aspects of the setting, so any intervention needs to anticipate its impact across the entire setting, and be prepared for unintended consequences.\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst-order and second-order changeBecause community psychologists often work on social issues, they are often working toward positive social change. Watzlawick, et al. (1974) differentiated between first-order and second-order change and how second-order change is often the focus of community psychology.Watzlawick, P., Weakland, J., & Fisch, R. (1974). "Change: Principles of problem formation and problem resolution". New York: Norton.\u000a\u000afirst-order change: changing the individuals in a setting to attempt to fix a problem\u000asecond-order change: Attending to systems and structures involved with the problem to adjust the person-environment fit\u000a\u000aAs an example of how these methods differ, consider homelessness. A first-order change to "fix" homelessness would be to offer shelter to one or many homeless people. A second-order change would be to address issues in policy regarding affordable housing.\u000aEmpowermentOne of the goals of community psychology involves empowerment of individuals and communities that have been marginalized by society.One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources" (Cornell Empowerment Group).Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology", 43-63.Rappaport''s (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in human Services, 3, 1-7.While empowerment has had an important place in community psychology research and literature, some have criticized its use. Riger (1993), for example, points to the paradoxical nature of empowerment being a masculine, individualistic construct being used in community research.Riger, S. (1993). What''s wrong with empowerment? "American Journal of Community Psychology", 21(3), 279-292\u000aSocial justiceA core value of community psychology is seeking social justice through research and action. Community psychologists are often advocates for equality and policies that allow for the wellbeing of all people, particularly marginalized populations.\u000aDiversityAnother value of community psychology involves embracing diversity. Rappaport includes diversity as a defining aspect of the field, calling research to be done for the benefit of diverse populations in gaining equality and justice. This value is seen through much of the research done with communities regardless of ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability status, socioeconomic status, gender and age.\u000aIndividual wellnessIndividual wellness is the physical and psychological wellbeing of all people. Research in community psychology focuses on methods to increase individual wellness, particularly through prevention and second-order change.\u000aCitizen participationCitizen participation refers to the ability of individuals to have a voice in decision-making, defining and addressing problems, and the dissemination of information gathered on them. This is the basis for the usage of participatory action research in community psychology, where community members are often involved in the research process by sharing their unique knowledge and experience with the research team and working as co-researchers.\u000aCollaboration and community strengthsCollaboration with community members to construct research and action projects makes community psychology an exceptionally applied field. By allowing communities to use their knowledge to contribute to projects in a collaborative, fair and equal manner, the process of research can itself be empowering to citizens. This requires an ongoing relationship between the researcher and the community from before the research begins to after the research is over.\u000aPsychological sense of communityPsychological sense of community (or simply sense of community), was introduced in 1974 by Seymour SarasonSarason, S.B. (1974). The psychological sense of community: Prospects for a community psychology. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.. In 1986 a major step was taken by David McMillanMcMillan, D.W., & Chavis, D.M. (1986). Sense of community: A definition and theory. American Journal of Community Psychology, 14(1), 6-23. and David ChavisChavis, D.M., & Wandersman, A. (1990). Sense of community in the urban environment: A catalyst for participation and community development. American Journal of Community Psychology, 18(1), 55-81. with the publication of their Theory of Sense of Community and Sense of Community Index. Originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, the Sense of Community Index (SCI) can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the workplace, schools, religious communities, communities of interest, etc.\u000aEmpirical groundingCommunity psychology grounds all advocacy and social justice action in empiricism. This empirical grounding is what separates community psychology from a social movement or grassroots organization. Methods from psychology have been adapted for use in the field that acknowledge value-driven, subjective research involving community members. The methods used in community psychology are therefore tailored to each individual research question. Quantitative as well as qualitative methods and other innovative methods are embraced.\u000aEducation\u000aEducation Connection{{Col-begin}}\u000a\u000aFor information about Education in Community Psychology\u000aMany programs related to community psychology are housed in psychology departments, while others are interdisciplinary. Students earning a community psychology degree complete courses that focus on: history and concepts of the field, human diversity and cultural competence, public health, community research methods and statistics, collaborative work in communities, organizational and community development and consultation, prevention and intervention, program evaluation, and grantwriting. Research is a large component of both the Ph.D. and masters degrees, as community psychologists base interventions on theory and research and use action-oriented research to promote positive change. Further, students will generally find niches under faculty mentors at their institutions related to local programs, organizations, grants, special populations, or social issues of interest\u2014granting students the chance to have practice doing the work of a community psychologist, under the supervision of a faculty member. *Idealist.org\u000a\u000aA complete list of academic programs in Community Psychology http://www.scra27.org/resources/educationc/academicpr\u000a\u000a\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a{{Col-begin}}\u000a{{Col-2}}\u000a\u000aBehavior settings\u000aCommunity Organizing\u000aGroup Dynamics\u000aSystems Thinking\u000aSocial Capital\u000aSocial Institutions\u000a{{Col-2}}\u000a\u000aEthnography\u000aGrounded Theory\u000aMultilevel model\u000aPhotovoice\u000aProgram evaluation\u000a{{Col-end}}\u000aPeer-reviewed journalsThe following journals provide peer-reviewed articles related to community psychology:\u000a\u000aAmerican Journal of Community Psychology (Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA) journal)\u000aThe Australian Community Psychologist (Journal of the Australian Psychological Society)APS College of Community Psychologists: Publications.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(28,0,'{{Redirect}}\u000a{{Redirect}}An ethnic group is a group of people whose members identify with each other, through a common heritage that is real or assumed.Smith 1987{{page number}}Marcus Banks, Ethnicity: Anthropological Constructions (1996), p. 151 "''ethnic groups'' invariably stress common ancestry or endogamy". This shared heritage may be based upon putative common ancestry, history, kinship, religion, language, shared territory, nationality or physical appearance. Members of an ethnic group are conscious of belonging to an ethnic group; moreover ethnic identity is further marked by the recognition from others of a group''s distinctiveness."Anthropology. The study of ethnicity, minority groups, and identity," Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007.{{cite book}}According to "Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality", a conference organised by Statistics Canada and the United States Census Bureau (April 1\u20133, 1992), "Ethnicity is a fundamental factor in human life: it is a phenomenon inherent in human experience."Statistics Canada However, many social scientists, such as anthropologists Fredrik Barth and Eric Wolf, do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.Fredrik Barth ed. 1969 Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Cultural Difference; Eric Wolf 1982 Europe and the People Without History p. 381Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time. Historians and cultural anthropologists have documented, however, that often many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983), The Invention of Tradition, Sider 1993 Lumbee Indian Histories.Seidner,(1982), Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective, pp. 2-3According to Thomas Hylland Eriksen, the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently. One is between "primordialism" and "instrumentalism". In the primordialist view, the participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, as an externally given, even coercive, social bond.Geertz, Clifford, ed. (1967) Old Societies and New States: The Quest for Modernity in Africa and Asia. New York: The Free Press. The instrumentalist approach, on the other hand, treats ethnicity primarily as an ad-hoc element of a political strategy, used as a resource for interest groups for achieving secondary goals such as, for instance, an increase in wealth, power or status.Cohen, Abner (1969) Custom and Politics in Urban Africa: A Study of Hausa Migrants in a Yoruba Town. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.Abner Cohen (1974) Two-Dimensional Man: An essay on power and symbolism in complex society. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul. This debate is still an important point of reference in Political science, although most scholars'' approaches fall between the two poles.J. Hutchinson & A.D. Smith (eds.), Oxford readers: Ethnicity (Oxford 1996), "Introduction", 8-9The second debate is between "constructivism" and "essentialism". Constructivists view national and ethnic identities as the product of historical forces, often recent, even when the identities are presented as old.Gellner, Ernest (1983) Nations and Nationalism. Oxford: Blackwell.Ernest Gellner (1997) Nationalism. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Essentialists view such identities as ontological categories defining social actors, and not the result of social action.Smith, Anthony D. (1986) The Ethnic Origins of Nations. Oxford: Blackwell.Anthony Smith (1991) National Identity. Harmondsworth: Penguin.According to Eriksen, these debates have been superseded, especially in anthropology, by scholars'' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia.T.H.

Oxford: Oxford University Press''. 2001\u000aDefining ethnicityThe terms "ethnicity" and "ethnic group" are derived from the Greek word ethnos, normally translated as "nation" or commonly said people of the same race that share a distinctive culture. The term "ethnic" and related forms were used in English in the meaning of "pagan/ heathen" from the 14th century through the middle of the 19th century.  ThiE. Tonkin, M. McDonald and M.

Smith (eds.), Oxford readers: Ethnicity (Oxford 1996), pp.&nbsp;18\u201324)The modern usage of "ethnic group", however, reflects the different kinds of encounters industrialised states have had with subordinate groups, such as immigrants and colonised subjects; "ethnic group" came to stand in opposition to "nation", to refer to people with distinct cultural identities who, through migration or conquest, had become subject to a foreign state.

In North America, by contrast, &#39;[race]&#39; most commonly means color, and &#39;ethnics&#39; are the descendents of relatively recent immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. &#39;[Ethnic]&#39; is not a noun in Britain. In effect there are no &#39;ethnics&#39;; there are only &#39;ethnic relations&#39;.Wallman, S. "Ethnicity research in Britain", Current Anthropology, v. 18, n. 3, 1977, pp. 531\u2013532.\u000aThus, in today''s everyday language, the words "ethnic" and "ethnicity" still have a ring of exotic peoples, minority issues and race relations.Within the social sciences, however, the usage has become more generalized to all human groups that explicitly regard themselves and are regarded by others as culturally distinctive.Eriksen 1993 p. 2 Among the first to bring the term "ethnic group" into social studies was the German sociologist Max Weber, who defined it as: [T]hose human groups that entertain a subjective belief in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or of customs or both, or because of memories of colonization and migration; this belief must be important for group formation; furthermore it does not matter whether an objective blood relationship exists.Max Weber [1922]1978 Economy and Society eds. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich, trans. Ephraim Fischof, vol. 2 Berkeley: University of California Press, 389 \u000a\u000aConceptual history of ethnicityWeber maintained that ethnic groups were k\u00fcnstlich (artificial, i.e. a social construct) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared Gemeinschaft (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called "race".Banton, Michael. (2007) "Weber on Ethnic Communities: A critique", Nations and Nationalism 13 (1), 2007, 19\u201335.Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose "Ethnic Groups and Boundaries" from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s.Ronald Cohen 1978 "Ethnicity: Problem and Focus in Anthropology", Annual Review of Anthropology 7: 383 Palo Alto: Stanford University Press  Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification.  Barth''s view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical a prioris to which people naturally belong.  He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups.  "Ethnic Groups and Boundaries", therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities.  Barth writes: "[...] categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories."In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of "ethnic groups" in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:\u000a... the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed. In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group.  He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as "cultural" or "tribal" when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that "ethnicity" had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies.  Cohen also suggested that claims concerning "ethnic" identity (like earlier claims concerning "tribal" identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.Ronald Cohen 1978 "Ethnicity: Problem and Focus in Anthropology", Annual Review of Anthropology 7: 383-384 Palo Alto: Stanford University PressSocial scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient.  Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.Joan Vincent 1974, "The Structure of Ethnicity" in Human Organization 33(4): 375-379  Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is "a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness".  He agrees with Joan Vincent''s observation that (in Cohen''s paraphrase) "Ethnicity ... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.  This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.\u000aEthnies and ethnic categoriesIn order to avoid the problems of defining ethnic classification as labelling of others or as self-identification, it has been proposed to distinguish between concepts of "ethnic categories", "ethnic networks" and "ethnic communities" or "ethnies".{{Harv}}Delanty, Gerard & Krishan Kumar (2006) The SAGE Handbook of Nations and Nationalism.

But, members who are ascribed to ethnic categories do not themselves have any awareness of their belonging to a common, distinctive group.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the level of &#34;ethnic networks&#34;, the group begins to have a sense of collectiveness, and at this level, common myths of origin and shared cultural and biological heritage begins to emerge, at least among the \u00e9lites.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the level of &#34;ethnies&#34; or &#34;ethnic communities&#34;, the members themselves have clear conceptions of being &#34;a named human population with myths of common ancestry, shared historical memories, and one or more common elements of culture, including an association with a homeland, and some degree of solidarity, at least among the \u00e9lites&#34;.

Anthony Giddens, Mitchell Duneier, Richard Appelbaum, Deborah Carr\u000a\u000a\u000aApproaches to understanding ethnicityDifferent approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society.  Examples of such approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.\u000a\u000a&#34;Primordialism&#34;, holds that ethnicity has existed at all times of human history and that modern ethnic groups have historical continuity into the far past. For them, the idea of ethnicity is closely linked to the idea of nations and is rooted in the pre-Weber understanding of humanity as being divided into primordially existing groups rooted by kinship and biological heritage.\u000a&#34;Essentialist primordialism&#34; further holds that ethnicity is an a priori fact of human existence, that ethnicity precedes any human social interaction and that it is basically unchanged by it. This theory sees ethnic groups as natural, not just as historical.  This understanding does not explain how and why nations and ethnic groups seemingly appear, disappear and often reappear through history.  It also has problems dealing with the consequences of intermarriage, migration and colonization for the composition of modern day multi-ethnic societies.\u000a&#34;Kinship primordialism&#34; holds that ethnic communities are extensions of kinship units, basically being derived by kinship or clan ties where the choices of cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) are made exactly to show this biological affinity. In this way, the myths of common biological ancestry that are a defining feature of ethnic communities are to be understood as representing actual biological history.  A problem with this view on ethnicity is that it is more often than not the case that mythic origins of specific ethnic groups directly contradict the known biological history of an ethnic community.\u000a&#34;Geertz''s primordialism&#34;, notably espoused by anthropologist Clifford Geertz, argues that humans in general attribute an overwhelming power to primordial human &#34;givens&#34; such as blood ties, language, territory, and cultural differences. In Geertz&#39; opinion, ethnicity is not in itself primordial but humans perceive it as such because it is embedded in their experience of the world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a&#34;Perennialism&#34; holds that ethnicity is ever changing, and that while the concept of ethnicity has existed at all times, ethnic groups are generally short lived before the ethnic boundaries realign in new patterns. The opposing perennialist view holds that while ethnicity and ethnic groupings has existed throughout history, they are not part of the natural order.\u000a&#34;Perpetual perennialism&#34; holds that specific ethnic groups have existed continuously throughout history.\u000a&#34;Situational perennialism&#34; holds that nations and ethnic groups emerge, change and vanish through the course of history. This view holds that the concept of ethnicity is basically a tool used by political groups to manipulate resources such as wealth, power, territory or status in their particular groups&#39; interests.  Accordingly, ethnicity emerges when it is relevant as means of furthering emergent collective interests and changes according to political changes in the society. Examples of a perennialist interpretation of ethnicity are also found in Barth,and Seidner who see ethnicity as ever-changing boundaries between groups of people established through ongoing social negotiation and interaction.\u000a&#34;Instrumentalist perennialism&#34;, while seeing ethnicity primarily as a versatile tool that identified different ethnics groups and limits through time, explains ethnicity as a mechanism of social stratification, meaning that ethnicity is the basis for a hierarchical arrangement of individuals.  According to Donald Noel, a sociologist who developed a theory on the origin of ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification is a &#34;system of stratification wherein some relatively fixed group membership (e.g., race, religion, or nationality) is utilized as a major criterion for assigning social positions&#34;.{{cite journal}} Ethnic stratification is one of many different types of social stratification, including stratification based on socio-economic status, race, or gender. According to Donald Noel, ethnic stratification will emerge only when specific ethnic groups are brought into contact with one another, and only when those groups are characterized by a high degree of ethnocentrism, competition, and differential power. Ethnocentrism is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one&#39;s own culture, and to downgrade all other groups outside one\u2019s own culture.  Some sociologists, such as Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings, say the origin of ethnic stratification lies in individual dispositions of ethnic prejudice, which relates to the theory of ethnocentrism.{{cite journal}} Continuing with Noel&#39;s theory, some degree of differential power must be present for the emergence of ethnic stratification. In other words, an inequality of power among ethnic groups means &#34;they are of such unequal power that one is able to impose its will upon another&#34;. In addition to differential power, a degree of competition structured along ethnic lines is a prerequisite to ethnic stratification as well. The different ethnic groups must be competing for some common goal, such as power or influence, or a material interest, such as wealth or territory. Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings propose that competition is driven by self-interest and hostility, and results in inevitable stratification and conflict.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a&#34;Constructivism&#34; sees both primordialist and perennialist views as basically flawed, and rejects the notion of ethnicity as a basic human condition.  It holds that ethnic groups are only products of human social interaction, maintained only in so far as they are maintained as valid social constructs in societies.\u000a&#34;Modernist constructivism&#34; correlates the emergence of ethnicity with the movement towards nationstates beginning in the early modern period.{{Harv}}  Proponents of this theory, such as Eric Hobsbawm, argue that ethnicity and notions of ethnic pride, such as nationalism, are purely modern inventions, appearing only in the modern period of world history. They hold that prior to this, ethnic homogeneity was not considered an ideal or necessary factor in the forging of large-scale societies.\u000a\u000a\u000aEthnicity and raceBefore Weber, race and ethnicity were often seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity was predominant, cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.Banton, Michael. (2007) "Weber on Ethnic Communities: A critique", Nations and Nationalism 13 (1), 2007, 19\u201335.  This was the time when "sciences" such as phrenology claimed to be able to correlate cultural and behavioral traits of different populations with their outward physical characteristics, such as the shape of the skull.With Weber''s introduction of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity were divided from each other.  A social belief in biologically well-defined races lingered on. In 1950, the UNESCO statement, "The Race Question", signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including Ashley Montagu, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Gunnar Myrdal, Julian Huxley, etc.), suggested that: "National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term ''race'' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term ''race'' altogether and speak of ''ethnic groups''."A. Metraux (1950) "United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race", American Anthropologist 53(1): 142-145)In 1982, American cultural anthropologists, summing up forty years of ethnographic research, argued that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:\u000a\u000aThe opposing interests that divide the working classes are further reinforced through appeals to &#34;racial&#34; and &#34;ethnic&#34; distinctions.  Such appeals serve to allocate different categories of workers to rungs on the scale of labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations to the lower levels and insulating the higher echelons from competition from below.  Capitalism did not create all the distinctions of ethnicity and race that function to set off categories of workers from one another.  It is, nevertheless, the process of labor mobilization under capitalism that imparts to these distinctions their effective values.\u000aAccording to Wolf, races were constructed and incorporated during the period of European mercantile expansion, and ethnic groups during the period of capitalist expansion.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOften, ethnicity also connotes shared cultural, linguistic, behavioural or religious traits.  For example, to call oneself Jewish or Arab is to immediately invoke a clutch of linguistic, religious, cultural and racial features that are held to be common within each ethnic category. Such broad ethnic categories have also been termed macroethnicity.Maria Rostworowski, "The Incas", Peru Culture  This distinguishes them from smaller, more subjective ethnic features, often termed microethnicity.James Lockhart, Microethnicity in Philological ethnohistoryChristopher Larkosh, "Je me souviens\u2026aussi: Microethnicity and the Fragility of Memory in French-Canadian New England", TOPIA: Journal for Canadian Cultural Studies, Issue 16 (Toronto, 2006), pp. 91-108\u000aEthnicity and nationIn some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality.  Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest GellnerGellner 2006 Nations and Nationalism Blackwell Publishing and Benedict AndersonAnderson 2006 Imagined Communities Verson see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the seventeenth century.  They culminated in the rise of "nation-states" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries.\u000aThus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and nation, developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when mercantilism and capitalism were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that state boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.  In the nineteenth century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent "nations."  Nation-states, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another.  Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state.Walter Pohl, "Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies", Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings, ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, pp 13-24, notes that historians have projected the nineteenth-century conceptions of the nation-state backwards in time, employing biological metaphors of birth and growth: "that the peoples in the Migration Period had little to do with those heroic (or sometimes brutish) clich\u00e9s is now generally accepted among historians," he remarked. Early medieval peoples were far less homogeneous than often thought, and Pohl follows Reinhard Wenskus, Stammesbildung und Verfassung. (Cologne and Graz) 1961, whose researches into the "ethnogenesis" of the German peoples convinced him that the idea of common origin, as expressed by Isidore of Seville Gens est multitudo ab uno principio orta ("a people is a multitude stemming from one origin") which continues in the original Etymologiae IX.2.i) "sive ab alia natione secundum propriam collectionem distincta ("or distinguished from another people by its proper ties") was a myth.  Under these conditions\u2014when people moved from one state to another,Aihway Ong 1996 "Cultural Citizenship in the Making" in Current Anthropology 37(5) or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries\u2014ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.\u000aEthno-national conflict{{See}}\u000aSometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the twentieth century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways.  Some, like J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects.  According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals.  Others, like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka, argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct.  According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.The nineteenth century saw the development of the political ideology of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was tied to nationalism, first by German theorists including Johann Gottfried von Herder. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the nineteenth century consolidation and expansion of the German Empire and the twentieth century Third (Greater German) Reich.  Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by inter-ethnic conflicts.  Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world.  Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as civil wars when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.\u000aEthnicity in specific countriesIn the United States of America, the term "ethnic" carries a much broader meaning than how it is commonly used in some other countries. Ethnicity usually refers to collectives of related groups, having more to do with morphology, specifically skin color, rather than political boundaries. The word "nationality" is more commonly used for this purpose (e.g. Italian, German, French, Russian, Japanese, etc. are nationalities). Most prominently in the U.S., Latin American derived populations are grouped in a "Hispanic" or "Latino" ethnicity. The many previously designated Oriental ethnic groups are now classified as the Asian racial group for the census.The terms "Black" and "African American", while different, are both used as ethnic categories in the US. In the late 1980s, the term "African American", was posited as the most appropriate and politically correct race designation.Encyclopedia of Public Health, by The Gale Group, Inc While it was intended as a shift away from the racial inequities of America''s past often associated with the historical views of the "Black race", it largely became a simple replacement for the terms Black, Colored, Negro and the like, referring to any individual of dark skin color regardless of geographical descent. Likewise, Light-skinned Americans from Africa are not considered "African American". Many African Americans are multiracial. More than half of African Americans also have European ancestry equivalent to one great-grandparent, and 5 percent have Native American ancestry equivalent to one great-grandparent.Henry Louis Gates, Jr., In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past, New York: Crown Publishers, 2009, pp. 20-21The term "White" generally describes people whose ancestry can be traced to Europe (including other European-settled countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cuba, New Zealand and South Africa among others) and who now live in the United States. Middle Easterners may sometimes also be included in the "white" category.  This includes people from Southwest Asia and North Africa, as well as the Arab nations, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. All the aforementioned are categorized as part of the "White" racial group, as per US Census categorization.  This category has been split into two groups: Hispanics and non-Hispanics (e.g. White non-Hispanic and White Hispanic.) Although people from East Asia may typically have light skin, they are not considered "white" due to their mongoloid origin, which reflects upon the socially-constructed nature of racial groups.In the United Kingdom, many different ethnic classifications, both formal and informal, are used. Perhaps the most accepted is the National Statistics classification, identical to that used in the 2001 Census in England and Wales (see Ethnicity (United Kingdom)). The classification White British is used to refer to the indigenous British people. The term Oriental refers to people from China, Japan, Korea and the Pacific Rim while Asian is used to refer to people from the Indian subcontinent; India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.China officially recognizes 56 ethnic groups, the largest of which is the Han Chinese.  Many of the ethnic minorities maintain their own cultures, languages and identity although many are also becoming more westernised.  Han-Chinese predominate demographically and politically in most areas of China, although less so in Tibet and Xinjiang, where the Han are still in the minority.  The Han Chinese was the only ethnic group bound by the one-child policy.

The term is sometimes used to refer specifically to economic globalization: the integration of national economies into the international economy through trade, foreign direct investment, capital flows, migration, and the spread of technology.{{cite book}} However, globalization is usually recognized as being driven by a combination of economic, technological, sociocultural, political, and biological factors.Sheila L. Croucher. Globalization and Belonging: The Politics of Identity in a Changing World. Rowman & Littlefield. (2004). p.10 The term can also refer to the transnational circulation of ideas, languages, or popular culture through acculturation.\u000aDefinitions\u000aAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word ''globalization'' was first employed in 1930, in the context of an holistic view of human experience in education.W. Boyd & M M MacKenzie. Towards New Education IV''. (1930). p. 350 An early description of globalization was penned by the American entrepreneur-turned-minister Charles Taze Russell who coined the term ''corporate giants'' in 1897,The Battle of Armageddon, October, 1897 pages 365\u2013370 although it was not until the 1960s that the term began to be widely used by economists and other social scientists. The term has since then achieved widespread use in the mainstream press by the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired numerous competing definitions and interpretations, with antecedents dating back to the great movements of trade and empire across Asia and the Indian Ocean from the 15th century onwards.A.G. Hopkins, ed. "Globalization in World History". Norton. (2004). pp. 4-8The United Nations ESCWA has written that globalization "is a widely-used term that can be defined in a number of different ways. When used in an economic context, it refers to the reduction and removal of barriers between national borders in order to facilitate the flow of goods, capital, services and labor... although considerable barriers remain to the flow of labor... Globalization is not a new phenomenon. It began in the late nineteenth century, but it slowed down during the period from the start of the First World War until the third quarter of the twentieth century.  This slowdown can be attributed to the inward-looking policies pursued by a number of countries in order to protect their respective industries... however, the pace of globalization picked up rapidly during the fourth quarter of the twentieth century..."Summary of the Annual Review of Developments in Globalization and Regional Integration in the Countries of the ESCWA Region by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western AsiaSaskia Sassen writes that "a good part of globalization consists of an enormous variety of micro-processes that begin to denationalize what had been constructed as national&nbsp;\u2014 whether policies, capital, political subjectivity, urban spaces, temporal frames, or any other of a variety of dynamics and domains."{{cite book}}\u000aTom J. Palmer of the Cato Institute defines globalization as "the diminution or elimination of state-enforced restrictions on exchanges across borders and the increasingly integrated and complex global system of production and exchange that has emerged as a result."Globalization Is Great! by Tom G. Palmer, Senior Fellow, Cato InstituteThomas L. Friedman has examined the impact of the "flattening" of the world, and argues that globalized trade, outsourcing, supply-chaining, and political forces have changed the world permanently, for both better and worse. He also argues that the pace of globalization is quickening and will continue to have a growing impact on business organization and practice.Friedman,Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". Emergin: A Reader. Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49Noam Chomsky argues that the word globalization is also used, in a doctrinal sense, to describe the neoliberal form of economic globalization.ZNet, Corporate Globalization, Korea and International Affairs, Noam Chomsky interviewed by Sun Woo Lee, Monthly JoongAng, 22 February 2006Herman E. Daly argues that sometimes the terms internationalization and globalization are used interchangeably but there is a significant formal difference. The term "internationalization" (or internationalisation) refers to the importance of international trade, relations, treaties etc. owing to the (hypothetical) immobility of labor and capital between or among nations.{{Citation needed}}Finally, Takis Fotopoulos argues that globalization is the result of systemic trends manifesting the market economy''s grow-or-die dynamic, following the rapid expansion of transnational corporations. Because these trends have not been offset effectively by counter-tendencies that could have emanated from trade-union action and other forms of political activity, the outcome has been globalisation. This is a multi-faceted and irreversible phenomenon within the system of the market economy and it is expressed as: economic globalisation, namely, the opening and deregulation of commodity, capital and labour markets which led to the present form of neoliberal globalisation; political globalisation, i.e., the emergence of a transnational elite and the phasing out of the all powerful-nation state of the statist period; cultural globalisation, i.e., the worldwide homogenisation of culture; ideological globalisation; technological globalisation; social globalisation.\u201cGlobalisation, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalisation \u2018Movement\u2019\u201d, Takis Fotopoulos, Democracy & Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol.7, No.2, (July 2001),\u000aHistory\u000aThe historical origins of globalization are the subject of on-going debate. Though some scholars situate the origins of globalization in the modern era, others regard it as a phenomenon with a long history.Perhaps the most extreme proponent of a deep historical origin for globalization was Andre Gunder Frank, an economist associated with dependency theory. Frank argued that a form of globalization has been in existence since the rise of trade links between Sumer and the Indus Valley Civilization in the third millennium B.C.Andre Gunder Frank, "Reorient: Global economy in the Asian age" U.C. Berkeley Press, 1998. Critics of this idea point out that it rests upon an over-broad definition of globalization.An early form of globalized economics and culture existed during the Hellenistic Age, when commercialized urban centers were focused around the axis of Greek culture over a wide range that stretched from India to Spain, with such cities as Alexandria, Athens, and Antioch at its center. Trade was widespread during that period, and it is the first time the idea of a cosmopolitan culture (from Greek "Cosmopolis", meaning "world city") emerged. Others have perceived an early form of globalization in the trade links between the Roman Empire, the Parthian Empire, and the Han Dynasty. The increasing articulation of commercial links between these powers inspired the development of the Silk Road, which started in western China, reached the boundaries of the Parthian empire, and continued onwards towards Rome.Ancient Silk Road Travellers  With 300 Greek ships a year sailing between the Greco-Roman world and India, the annual trade may have reached 300,000 tons."The Origins of Globalization", Ivey Business Journal. The Islamic Golden Age was also an important early stage of globalization, when Jewish and Muslim traders and explorers established a sustained economy across the Old World resulting in a globalization of crops, trade, knowledge and technology. Globally significant crops such as sugar and cotton became widely cultivated across the Muslim world in this period, while the necessity of learning Arabic and completing the Hajj created a cosmopolitan culture.John M. Hobson (2004), The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation, p. 29-30, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-54724-5.\u000aThe advent of the Mongol Empire, though destabilizing to the commercial centers of the Middle East and China, greatly facilitated travel along the Silk Road. This permitted travelers and missionaries such as Marco Polo to journey successfully (and profitably) from one end of Eurasia to the other. The so-called Pax Mongolica of the thirteenth century had several other notable globalizing effects. It witnessed the creation of the first international postal service, as well as the rapid transmission of epidemic diseases such as bubonic plague across the newly unified regions of Central Asia.Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World, Crown, 2004 These pre-modern phases of global or hemispheric exchange are sometimes known as archaic globalization. Up to the sixteenth century, however, even the largest systems of international exchange were limited to the Old World. The Age of Discovery brought a broad change in globalization, being the first period in which Eurasia and Africa engaged in substantial cultural, material and biologic exchange with the New World."The Age of Exploration", Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009.

Shortly before the turn of the 16th century, Portuguese started establishing trading posts (factories) from Africa to Asia and Brazil, to deal with the trade of local products like gold, spices and timber, introducing an international business center under a royal monopoly, the House of India.House of India, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Global integration continued with the European colonization of the Americas initiating the Columbian Exchange,Crosby, Alfred W., "The Columbian exchange: biological and cultural consequences of 1492", Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 0275980731 the enormous widespread exchange of plants, animals, foods, human populations (including slaves), communicable diseases, and culture between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. It was one of the most significant global events concerning ecology, agriculture, and culture in  history. New crops that had come from the Americas via the European seafarers in the 16th century significantly contributed to the world''s population growth."The Columbian Exchange". The University of North Carolina.  This phase is sometimes known as proto-globalization. It was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the Portuguese and Spanish Empires, and later the Dutch and British Empires. In the 17th century, globalization became also a private business phenomenon when chartered companies like British East India Company (founded in 1600), often described as the first multinational corporation, as well as the Dutch East India Company (founded in 1602) were established. Because of the large investment and financing needs and high risks involved in international trade, the British East India Company became the first company in the world to share risk and enable joint ownership of companies through the issuance of shares of stock: an important driver for globalization.{{Citation needed}}\u000a\u000aThe 19th century witnessed the advent of globalization approaching its modern form. Industrialization allowed cheap production of household items using economies of scale, while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism. After the Opium Wars and the completion of British conquest of India, vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of European exports. It was in this period that areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system. Meanwhile, the conquest of new parts of the globe, notably sub-Saharan Africa, by Europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as rubber, diamonds and coal and helped fuel trade and investment between the European imperial powers, their colonies, and the United States.{{Citation needed}} Said John Maynard Keynes,PBS.org{{cquote}} The first phase of "modern globalization" began to break down at the beginning of the 20th century, with the first world war.

China has recently become the world''s largest exporter surpassing Germany."In Recession, China Solidifies Its Lead in Global Trade". The New York Times. October 13, 2009.\u000aModern globalizationGlobalization, since World War II, is largely the result of planning by politicians to break down borders hampering trade to increase prosperity and interdependence thereby decreasing the chance of future war. Their work led to the Bretton Woods conference, an agreement by the world''s leading politicians to lay down the framework for international commerce and finance, and the founding of several international institutions intended to oversee the processes of globalization.These institutions include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank), and the International Monetary Fund. Globalization has been facilitated by advances in technology which have reduced the costs of trade, and trade negotiation rounds, originally under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which led to a series of agreements to remove restrictions on free trade.Since World War II, barriers to international trade have been considerably lowered through international agreements&nbsp;\u2014 GATT. Particular initiatives carried out as a result of GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO), for which GATT is the foundation, have included:\u000a\u000aPromotion of free trade:\u000aelimination of tariffs; creation of free trade zones with small or no tariffs\u000aReduced transportation costs, especially resulting from development of containerization for ocean shipping.\u000aReduction or elimination of capital controls\u000aReduction, elimination, or harmonization of subsidies for local businesses\u000aCreation of subsidies for global corporations\u000aHarmonization of intellectual property laws across the majority of states, with more restrictions\u000aSupranational recognition of intellectual property restrictions (e.g. patents granted by China would be recognized in the United States)\u000aCultural globalization, driven by communication technology and the worldwide marketing of Western cultural industries, was understood at first as a process of homogenization, as the global domination of American culture at the expense of traditional diversity. However, a contrasting trend soon became evident in the emergence of movements protesting against globalization and giving new momentum to the defense of local uniqueness, individuality, and identity, but largely without success.Jurgen Osterhammel and Niels P.Petersson. Globalization: a short history. (2005) P.8The Uruguay Round (1986 to 1994)WTO.org,(2009) led to a treaty to create the WTO to mediate trade disputes and set up a uniform platform of trading. Other bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, including sections of Europe''s Maastricht Treaty and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have also been signed in pursuit of the goal of reducing tariffs and barriers to trade.World exports rose from 8.5% in 1970, to 16.2% of total gross world product in 2001.{{cite web}}\u000aMeasuring globalization\u000aLooking specifically at economic globalization demonstrates that it can be measured in different ways. These center around the four main economic flows that characterize globalization:\u000a\u000aGoods and services, e.g., exports plus imports as a proportion of national income or per capita of population\u000aLabor/people, e.g., net migration rates; inward or outward migration flows, weighted by population\u000aCapital, e.g., inward or outward direct investment as a proportion of national income or per head of population\u000aTechnology, e.g., international research &#38; development flows; proportion of populations (and rates of change thereof) using particular inventions (especially &#39;factor-neutral&#39; technological advances such as the telephone, motorcar, broadband)\u000a\u000aAs globalization is not only an economic phenomenon, a multivariate approach to measuring globalization is the recent index calculated by the Swiss think tank KOF. The index measures the three main dimensions of globalization: economic, social, and political. In addition to three indices measuring these dimensions, an overall index of globalization and sub-indices referring to actual economic flows, economic restrictions, data on personal contact, data on information flows, and data on cultural proximity is calculated. Data is available on a yearly basis for 122 countries, as detailed in Dreher, Gaston and Martens (2008).Axel Dreher, Noel Gaston, Pim Martens, Measuring Globalisation: Gauging Its Consequences, Springer, ISBN 978-0-387-74067-6. According to the index, the world''s most globalized country is Belgium, followed by Austria, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The least globalized countries according to the KOF-index are Haiti, Myanmar, the Central African Republic and Burundi.KOF Index of GlobalizationA.T. Kearney and Foreign Policy Magazine jointly publish another Globalization Index. According to the 2006 index, Singapore, Ireland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada and Denmark are the most globalized, while Indonesia, India and Iran are the least globalized among countries listed.\u000aEffects of globalizationGlobalization has various aspects which affect the world in several different ways such as:\u000a\u000aIndustrial - emergence of worldwide production markets and broader access to a range of foreign products for consumers and companies.

In developing nations under the demands of Structural Adjustment Programs, health systems are fragmented and privatized. Global health policy makers have shifted during the 1990s from United Nations players to financial institutions. The result of this power transition is an increase in privatization in the health sector. This privatization fragments health policy by crowding it with many players with many private interests. These fragmented policy players emphasize partnerships, specific interventions to combat specific problems (as opposed to comprehensive health strategies). Influenced by global trade and global economy, health policy is directed by technological advances and innovative medical trade. Global priorities, in this situation, are sometimes at odds with national priorities where increased health infrastructure and basic primary care are of more value to the public than privatized care for the wealthy.Ollila, E.

If China continues to grow at the rate projected by the trends, then it is very likely that in the next twenty years, there will be a major reallocation of power among the world leaders.

Culture is what people eat, how they dress, beliefs they hold, and activities they practice.  Globalization has joined different cultures and made it into something different. As Erla Zwingle, from the National Geographic article titled "Globalization" states, "When cultures receive outside influences, they ignore some and adopt others, and then almost immediately start to transform them."Magma.nationalgeographic.comOne classic culture aspect is food. Someone in America can be eating Japanese noodles for lunch while someone in Sydney, Australia is eating classic Italian meatballs. India is known for its curry and exotic spices. France is known for its cheeses. North America is known for its burgers and fries. McDonald''s is a North American company which is now a global enterprise with 31,000 locations worldwide. This company is just one example of food causing cultural influence on the global scale.Another common practice brought about by globalization is the usage of Chinese characters in tattoos.

Photo sharing websites allow interaction even where language would otherwise be a barrier.\u000aNegative effects{{See also}}\u000aGlobalization has been one of the most hotly debated topics in international economics over the past few years. Globalization has also generated significant international opposition over concerns that it has increased inequality and environmental degradation.Worldbank.org In the Midwestern United States, globalization has eaten away at its competitive edge in industry and agriculture, lowering the quality of life in locations that lack the opportunity to adapt to the change.Longworth, Richard, C. Caught in the Middle: America''s the Age of Globalism. New York: Bloomsbury, 2007.Some also view the effect of globalization on culture as a rising concern. Along with globalization of economies and trade, culture is being imported and exported as well. The concern is that the stronger, bigger countries such as the United States, may overrun the other, smaller countries'' cultures, leading to those customs and values being faded away. This process is also sometimes referred to as Americanization or McDonaldization. \u000aSteger, Manfred.Globalization. New York: Sterling Publishing, 2009.\u000aSweatshopsIt can be said that globalization is the door that opens up an otherwise resource-poor country to the international market. Where a country has little material or physical product harvested or mined from its own soil, large corporations see an opportunity to take advantage of the "export poverty" of such a nation. Where the majority of the earliest occurrences of economic globalization are recorded as being the expansion of businesses and corporate growth, in many poorer nations globalization is actually the result of the foreign businesses investing in the country to take advantage of the lower wage rate: even though investing, by increasing the Capital Stock of the country, increases their wage rate.One example used by anti-globalization protestors is the use of sweatshops by manufacturers. According to Global Exchange these "Sweat Shops" are widely used by sports shoe manufacturers and mentions one company in particular&nbsp;\u2013 Nike.Globalexchange.org There are factories set up in the poor countries where employees agree to work for low wages. Then if labour laws alter in those countries and stricter rules govern the manufacturing process the factories are closed down and relocated to other nations with more conservative, laissez-faire economic policies.{{Citation needed}}There are several agencies that have been set up worldwide specifically designed to focus on anti-sweatshop campaigns and education of such. In the USA, the National Labor Committee has proposed a number of bills as part of the The Decent Working Conditions and Fair Competition Act, which have thus far failed in Congress. The legislation would legally require companies to respect human and worker rights by prohibiting the import, sale, or export of sweatshop goods.GovTrack, S. 3485Specifically, these core standards include no child labor, no forced labor, freedom of association, right to organize and bargain collectively, as well as the right to decent working conditions.Educatingforjustrice.orgTiziana Terranova has stated that globalization has brought a culture of "free labour". In a digital sense, it is where the individuals (contributing capital) exploits and eventually "exhausts the means through which labour can sustain itself".

Rowden claims the consequences of these and other neoliberal policies have been chronically underfunded public health systems, dilapidated health infrastructures, inadequate numbers of health personnel, and demoralizing working conditions that have fueled the "push factors" driving the brain drain of doctors and nurses migrating from poor countries to rich ones, all of which has undermined public health systems and the fight against HIV/AIDS in developing countries.\u000aEffect on environmental degradation\u000aThe Worldwatch Institute said the booming economies of China and India are planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere.

One article from 2001 found that significantly, in 7 out of 8 metrics, income inequality has increased in the twenty years ending 2001. Also, "incomes in the lower deciles of world income distribution have probably fallen absolutely since the 1980s". Furthermore, the World Bank''s figures on absolute poverty were challenged. The article was skeptical of the World Bank''s claim that the number of people living on less than $1 a day has held steady at 1.2 billion from 1987 to 1998, because of biased methodology.Wade, Robert Hunter.

So globalization, a much more diversified phenomenon, relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of objects, markets and so on into each others countries.Critics of globalization talk of Westernization. A 2005 UNESCO report2005 UNESCO report showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia but Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America''s and the European Union''s shares of cultural exports declined, while Asia''s cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia''s population and area are several times that of North America.Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as the promotion of corporatist interests.{{cite news}} They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of corporate entities shapes the political policy of countries.{{cite book}}{{cite book}}\u000aInternational Social ForumsSee main articles: European Social Forum, the Asian Social Forum,(Africa Social Forum), World Social Forum (WSF).The first WSF in 2001 was an initiative of the administration of Porto Alegre in Brazil. The slogan of the World Social Forum was "Another World Is Possible". It was here that the WSF''s Charter of Principles was adopted to provide a framework for the forums.It proved to be a vibrant player in macro level.The WSF became a periodic meeting: in 2002 and 2003 it was held again in Porto Alegre and became a rallying point for worldwide protest against the American invasion of Iraq. In 2004 it was moved to Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay, in India), to make it more accessible to the populations of Asia and Africa. This last appointment saw the participation of 75,000 delegates.In the meantime, regional forums took place following the example of the WSF, adopting its Charter of Principles. The first European Social Forum (ESF) was held in November 2002 in Florence. The slogan was "Against the war, against racism and against neo-liberalism". It saw the participation of 60,000 delegates and ended with a huge demonstration against the war (1,000,000 people according to the organizers). The other two ESFs took place in Paris and London, in 2003 and 2004 respectively.Recently there has been some discussion behind the movement about the role of the social forums. Some see them as a "popular university", an occasion to make many people aware of the problems of globalization. Others would prefer that delegates concentrate their efforts on the coordination and organization of the movement and on the planning of new campaigns. However it has often been argued that in the dominated countries (most of the world) the WSF is little more than an ''NGO fair'' driven by Northern NGOs and donors most of which are hostile to popular movements of the poor.Pambazuka News\u000aRelation to AmericanizationIn the past, the argument that globalization could in actuality have been the spreading of American culture could have been made.Americanization or Globalization? The thorough spreading of American culture throughout the world was apparent. For example, there were cola products shipped and sold in nearly every country in the world. American fashion also seemed to be trending in most other countries. Alongside this, the biggest economy and strongest army in the U.S.A could only help the impact of their assimilation of the rest of the world. Many of their inventions, like the iPod, have made their way around the world, and certainly, especially the technology, will remain for a long period of time. Their domination in so many world sports and creation of many others only provide more influence.However, despite this, in current times (2010) there can be made a new argument. America has been knocked off its pedestal of the greatest world power, and is making way for new ones, namely China and India. The spreading of Chinese products throughout the world is occurring rapidly. They have an, arguably, unmatched economy in the world. In addition to this, India is quickly becoming well known for its products too. The large country is the creator and supplier for mostly clothing, but other products too, for many countries in the world. These two countries are rapidly replacing American culture as the most widespread example of globalization in the world.\u000aSee also{{Colbegin}}\u000a\u000aAlter-globalization\u000aAmerican Imperialism\u000aArchaic globalization\u000aCivilizing mission\u000aColumbian Exchange\u000aCultural assimilation\u000aDeglobalization\u000aDevelopment criticism\u000aGlobal information system\u000aGlobal Trade Watch (Australia)\u000aGlobalism\u000aGlobality\u000aGreat Transition\u000aImpact of globalization on women in China\u000aInterdependence\u000aNew world order (politics)\u000aPostmodernism\u000aTransnational cinema\u000aVermeer''s Hat: The Seventeenth Century and the Dawn of the Global World\u000aWorld economy\u000a\u000a{{Colend}}\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aGlobalization: An Innovation Imperative (Keynote Presentation by Mr. Pari Natarajan, CEO, Zinnov)\u000aFurther reading{{refbegin}}\u000a\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000aBastardas-Boada, Albert (2002), &#34;World Language Policy in the Era of Globalization: Diversity and Intercommunication from the Perspective of &#39;Complexity&#39;&#34;, Noves SL, Revista de Socioling\u00fc\u00edstica (Barcelona), http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/noves/hm02estiu/metodologia/a_bastardas1_9.htm.\u000a{{cite book}}\u000aPeter Berger, Four Faces of Global Culture (The National Interest, Fall 1997).\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000aGernot Kohler and Emilio Jos\u00e9 Chaves (Editors) &#34;Globalization: Critical Perspectives&#34; Hauppauge, New York: Nova Science Publishers (http://www.novapublishers.com/) ISBN 1-59033-346-2.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(30,0,'{{Other uses6}}\u000aLawFrom Old English lagu "Words of Mel"; legal comes from Latin legalis, from lex "law", "statute" (Law, Online Etymology Dictionary; Legal, Merriam-Webster''s Online Dictionary) is a system of rules, usually enforced through a set of institutions.Robertson, Crimes against humanity, 90; see "analytical jurisprudence" for extensive debate on what law is; in The Concept of Law Hart argued law is a "system of rules" (Campbell, The Contribution of Legal Studies, 184); Austin said law was "the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction" (Bix, John Austin); Dworkin describes law as an "interpretive concept" to achieve justice (Dworkin, Law''s Empire, 410); and Raz argues law is an "authority" to mediate people''s interests (Raz, The Authority of Law, 3\u201336). It shapes politics, economics and society in numerous ways and serves as a primary social mediator of relations between people. Contract law regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on derivatives markets. Property law defines rights and obligations related to the transfer and title of personal (often referred to as chattel) and real property. Trust law applies to assets held for investment and financial security, while tort law allows claims for compensation if a person''s rights or property are harmed. If the harm is criminalized in a statute, criminal law offers means by which the state can prosecute the perpetrator. Constitutional law provides a framework for the creation of law, the protection of human rights and the election of political representatives. Administrative law is used to review the decisions of government agencies, while international law governs affairs between sovereign nation states in activities ranging from trade to environmental regulation or military action. Writing in 350&nbsp;BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle declared, "The rule of law is better than the rule of any individual."n.b. this translation reads, "it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws." (Aristotle, Politics 3.16).Legal systems elaborate rights and responsibilities in a variety of ways. A general distinction can be made between civil law jurisdictions, which codify their laws, and common law systems, where judge made law is not consolidated. In some countries, religion informs the law. Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry, into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis or sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness and justice. "In its majestic equality", said the author Anatole France in 1894, "the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread."The original French is: "La loi, dans un grand souci d''\u00e9galit\u00e9, interdit aux riches comme aux pauvres de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain" (France, The Red Lily, Chapter VII). In a typical democracy, the central institutions for interpreting and creating law are the three main branches of government, namely an impartial judiciary, a democratic legislature, and an accountable executive. To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public, a government''s bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an independent legal profession and a vibrant civil society inform and support their progress.\u000aLegal subjects\u000aAll legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but each country categorises and identifies its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "public law" (a term related closely to the state, and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "private law" (which covers contract, tort and property).Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, Liability and Environment, 1\u20132). In civil law systems, contract and tort fall under a general law of obligations, while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or international conventions. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and trusts are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see Peter Birks'' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the Notice to Law Schools. although there are many further disciplines which may be of greater practical importance.\u000aInternational law{{Main}}\u000aInternational law can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.\u000a\u000aPublic international law concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The sources for public international law development are custom, practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the Geneva Conventions. Public international law can be formed by international organisations, such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the League of Nations to prevent the Second World War),History of the UN, United Nations. Winston Churchill (The Hinge of Fate, 719) comments on the League of Nations'' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League." the International Labour Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, or the International Monetary Fund. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the International Court of Justice as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, Crimes against Humanity, 90; Schermers-Blokker, International Institutional Law, 900\u2013901). However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.Petersmann, The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System, 32\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aConflict of laws (or &#34;private international law&#34; in civil law countries) concerns which jurisdiction a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction&#39;s law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting capital and labour supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the New York Convention 1958.Redfem, International Commercial Arbitration, 68\u201369\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEuropean Union law is the first and, so far, only example of a supranational legal framework. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements\u2014especially the Union of South American Nations\u2014are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and political institutions. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.Schermers\u2013Blokker, International Institutional Law, 943 As the European Court of Justice said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes &#34;a new legal order of international law&#34; for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.See the fundamental C-26/62 Van Gend en Loos v Nederlanse Administratie Der Belastingen, and Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L. decisions of the European Court.\u000a\u000a\u000aConstitutional and administrative law{{Main}}\u000aConstitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. Constitutional law concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or civil liberties of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the United States and France, have a single codified constitution, with a Bill of Rights. A few, like the United Kingdom, have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the body politic, from statute, case law and convention. A case named Entick v CarringtonEntick v Carrington (1765) 19 Howell''s State Trials 1030; [1765] 95 ER 807 illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick''s house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the Earl of Halifax, was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, Lord Camden, stated that,The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.{{cite web}}\u000aThe fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by John Locke, holds that the individual can do anything but that which is forbidden by law, and the state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law.Locke, The Second Treatise, Chapter 9, section 124Tamanaha, On the Rule of Law, 47 Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can apply for judicial review of actions or decisions by local councils, public services or government ministries, to ensure that they comply with the law. The first specialist administrative court was the Conseil d''\u00c9tat set up in 1799, as Napoleon assumed power in France.Auby, Administrative Law in France, 75\u000aCriminal law{{Main}}Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.Cesare Beccaria''s seminal treatise of 1763\u20131764 is titled On Crimes and Punishments (Dei delitti e delle pene). It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgement on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevents people from committing a crime in the first place.Brody, Acker and Logan, Criminal Law, 2; Wilson, Criminal Law, 2 Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of criminal procedure.Brody, Acker and Logan, Criminal Law, 2 The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or actus reus (guilty act).See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, Criminal Law, 205 about Robinson v California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). Second, the accused must have the requisite malicious intent to do a criminal act, or mens rea (guilty mind). However for so called "strict liability" crimes, an actus reus is enough.See e.g. Feinman, Law 111, 260\u2013261 about Powell v Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968). Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (dolus directus and dolus eventualis), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.D\u00f6rmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, Elements of War Crimes, 491Kaiser, Leistungsst\u00f6rungen, 333\u000aExamples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in self defence, or pleading insanity. Another example is in the 19th century English case of R v Dudley and Stephens, which tested a defence of "necessity". The Mignonette, sailing from Southampton to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17 year old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. Lord Coleridge, expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one''s life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to hang, but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew''s right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the Crown commuted their sentences to six months in jail.About R v Dudley and Stephens [1884] 14 QBD 273 DC, see Simpson, Cannibalism and the Common Law, 212\u2013217, 229\u2013237Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well. The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "The People v ..." or "R (for Rex or Regina) v ..." Also, lay juries are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be imprisonment, fines, state supervision (such as probation), or community service. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to sentencing, legal research, legislation, and rehabilitation.Pelser, Criminal Legislation, 198 On the international field, 111 countries are members of the International Criminal Court, which was established to try people for crimes against humanity.The States Parties to the Rome Statute, International Criminal Court\u000aContract law{{Main}}\u000aContract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept).Wehberg, Pacta Sunt Servanda, 775 In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people''s flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get \u00a3100. Many people sued for their \u00a3100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puff, a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer. People had given good consideration for it by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".About Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256, and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, Contract Law, 142\u2013143"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of estoppel or culpa in contrahendo, can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.Austotel v Franklins (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.e.g. In Germany, \u00a7 311 Abs. II BGB In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". Germany has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their ''abstraction principle'' (Abstraktionsprinzip) means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)\u00a7 105 Abs. II BGB the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. Unjust enrichment law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.Smith, The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law, 1037\u000aTort law{{Main}}\u000aTorts, sometimes called delicts, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.Bolton v Stone [1951] AC 850 Under the law of negligence, the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for his injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by Donoghue v Stevenson.Donoghue v Stevenson ([1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1). See the original text of the case in UK Law Online. A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of ginger beer (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a caf\u00e9 in Paisley. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The House of Lords decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue''s illness. Lord Atkin took a distinctly moral approach, and said,The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer''s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 532, 580\u000aThis became the basis for the four principles of negligence; (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a duty of care to provide safe drinks (2) he breached his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred but for his breach and (4) his act was the proximate cause, or not too remote a consequence, of her harm. Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.Sturges v Bridgman (1879) 11 Ch D 852 Under a nuisance claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as assault, battery or trespass. A better known tort is defamation, which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician''s reputation.e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd [2004] EWHC 2786 More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of labour law in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants [1901] AC 426 when statute does not provide immunity.In the UK, Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992; c.f. in the U.S., National Labor Relations Act\u000aProperty law{{Main}}\u000aProperty law governs valuable things that people call ''theirs''. Real property, sometimes called ''real estate'' refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.eg Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] 2 All ER 426 Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry, and sandwiches, or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie.Armory v Delamirie (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505 A chimney sweep''s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith''s apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice''s attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keeper") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy''s possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.Matthews, The Man of Property, 251\u2013274 By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.Savigny, Das Recht des Besitzes, 25 The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and mix our labour with our surroundings.Locke, Second Treatise on Civil Government, Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.\u000aEquity and trusts{{Main}}\u000aEquity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King''s keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge made law if he thought it equitable to do so.McGhee, Snell''s Equity, 7 This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a ''trust''. ''Trustees'' control property, whereas the ''beneficial'' (or ''equitable'') ownership of trust property is held by people known as ''beneficiaries''. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.c.f. Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1 In the early case of Keech v SandfordKeech v Sandford (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61 a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market''s lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,{{quote}}Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a stock market crash. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee''s duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.Nestl\u00e9 v National Westminster Bank plc [1993] 1 WLR 1260 This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people''s savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for charitable purposes, famous examples being the British Museum or the Rockefeller Foundation.\u000aFurther disciplines\u000aLaw spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.\u000a\u000aLaw and society\u000a\u000a\u000aLabour law is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves collective bargaining regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as job security, health and safety or a minimum wage.\u000aHuman rights, civil rights and human rights law are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights (which founded the European Court of Human Rights) and the U.S. Bill of Rights. The Treaty of Lisbon makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union legally binding in all member states except Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union \u2013 Poland and the United Kingdom.A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon, The Law Society\u000aCivil procedure and criminal procedure concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen&#39;s right to a fair trial or hearing.\u000aEvidence law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.\u000aImmigration law and nationality law concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose citizenship. Both also involve the right of asylum and the problem of stateless individuals.\u000aSocial security law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers&#39; allowances or housing benefits.\u000aFamily law covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLaw and commerce\u000aCompany law sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.Berle, Modern Corporation and Private Property The law of the modern company began with the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856, passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain limited liability under the separate legal personality of the corporation.\u000aCommercial law covers complex contract and property law. The law of agency, insurance law, bills of exchange, insolvency and bankruptcy law and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medi\u00e6val Lex Mercatoria. The UK Sale of Goods Acts and the US Uniform Commercial Code are examples of codified common law commercial principles.\u000aAdmiralty law and the Law of the Sea lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world&#39;s oceans and seas, where outside of a country&#39;s zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as salvage, maritime liens, and injuries to passengers.\u000aIntellectual property law aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights (copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related rights) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.WIPO, Intellectual Property, 3\u000aRestitution deals with the recovery of someone else&#39;s gain, rather than compensation for one&#39;s own loss.\u000aUnjust enrichment When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an &#34;absence of basis&#34; for a transaction) at another&#39;s expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLaw and regulation\u000a\u000a\u000aTax law involves regulations that concern value added tax, corporate tax, income tax.\u000aBanking law and financial regulation set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\u000aRegulation deals with the provision of public services and utilities. Water law is one example. Especially since privatisation became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. Energy, gas, telecomms and water are regulated industries in most OECD countries.\u000aCompetition law, known in the U.S. as antitrust law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as Roman decrees against price fixing and the English restraint of trade doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the Sherman Act and Clayton Act) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of consumer welfare.\u000aConsumer law could include anything from regulations on unfair contractual terms and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.\u000aEnvironmental law is increasingly important, especially in light of the Kyoto Protocol and the potential danger of climate change. Environmental protection also serves to penalise polluters within domestic legal systems.\u000a\u000a\u000aLegal systems{{Main}}\u000aIn general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous legal transplants, typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, Comparative Law and Economics, 71) The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or public law. A third type of legal system\u2014 accepted by some countries without separation of church and state\u2014is religious law, based on scriptures. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The sources that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.\u000aCivil law{{Main}}\u000aCivil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation\u2014especially codifications in constitutions or statutes passed by government\u2014and custom.Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (ius scriptum) or legislation, and "unwritten law" (ius non scriptum) or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, General Principles of Civil Law, 19; Washofsky, Taking Precedent Seriously, 7). Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the Babylonian Codex Hammurabi. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the Roman Empire whose texts were rediscovered in medieval Europe. Roman law in the days of the Roman Republic and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.Gordley-von Mehren, Comparative Study of Private Law, 18 Instead a lay person, iudex, was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.Gordley-von Mehren, Comparative Study of Private Law, 21 Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the state, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges'' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. During the 6th century AD in the Eastern Roman Empire, the Emperor Justinian I codified and consolidated the laws that had existed in Rome, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.Stein, Roman Law in European History, 32 This became known as the Corpus Juris Civilis. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."Stein, Roman Law in European History, 35 Western Europe, meanwhile, slowly slipped into the Dark Ages, and it was not until the 11th century that scholars in the University of Bologna rediscovered the texts and used them to interpret their own laws.Stein, Roman Law in European History, 43 Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from religious laws such as Canon law continued to spread throughout Europe until the Enlightenment; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the Code Civil, and Germany, with the B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the Japanese and Korean legal traditions.Hatzis, The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece, 253\u2013263Demirg\u00fc\u00e7-Kunt -Levine, Financial Structures and Economic Growth, 204 Today, countries that have civil law systems range from Russia and China to most of Central and Latin America.The World Factbook&nbsp;\u2014 Field Listing&nbsp;\u2013 Legal system, CIA The United States follows the common law system described below.\u000aCommon law and equity{{Main}}\u000aCommon law and equity are legal systems where decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged to be legal sources. The "doctrine of precedent", or stare decisis (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts. Common law systems also rely on statutes, passed by the legislature, but may make less of a systematic attempt to codify their laws than in a "civil law" system. Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the British Empire (except Malta, Scotland, the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the Canadian province of Quebec). In medieval England, the Norman conquest led to a unification of various tribal customs and hence a law "common" to the whole country. The common law developed when the English monarchy had been weakened by the enormous cost of fighting for control over large parts of France. King John had been forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or Magna Carta of 1215 also required that the King''s entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.Magna Carta, Fordham University A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralised. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the English Court of Common Pleas had five.Gordley-von Mehren, Comparative Study of Private Law, 4 This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a rigid and inflexible system of common law.Gordley-von Mehren, Comparative Study of Private Law, 3 As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King''s behalf the Lord Chancellor gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of Sir Thomas More, the first lawyer to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own Court of Chancery. At first, equity was often criticised as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor''s foot.Pollock (ed) Table Talk of John Selden (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. ''Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor''s foot." But over time it developed solid principles, especially under Lord Eldon.Gee v Pritchard (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414 In the 19th century the two systems were fused into one another. In developing the common law and equity, academic authors have always played an important part. William Blackstone, from around 1760, was the first scholar to describe and teach it.Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First&nbsp;\u2013 Chapter the First But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.Gordley-von Mehren, Comparative Study of Private Law, 17\u000aReligious law{{Main}}Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish Halakha and Islamic Sharia\u2014both of which translate as the "path to follow"\u2014while Christian canon law also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments. However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the Quran has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 159 Qiyas (reasoning by analogy), Ijma (consensus) and precedent. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as Sharia and Fiqh respectively. Another example is the Torah or Old Testament, in the Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The Halakha is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud''s interpretations. Nevertheless, Israeli law allows litigants to use religious laws only if they choose. Canon law is only in use by members of the clergy in the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion.Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the Muslim world in a non-codified form, with the Ottoman Empire''s Mecelle code in the 19th century being first attempt at codifying elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.Anderson, Law Reform in the Middle East, 43Giannoulatos, Islam, 274\u2013275 In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.Sherif, Constitutions of Arab Countries, 157\u2013158 Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.Saudi Arabia, Jurist Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.Akhlagi, Iranian Commercial Law, 127 During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of Islamic resurgence has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected world politics.Hallaq, The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law, 1\u000aLegal theory\u000aHistory of law{{Main}}The history of law is closely connected to the development of civilization. Ancient Egyptian law, dating as far back as 3000&nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of Ma''at, characterised by tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality.{{cite encyclopedia}}VerSteeg, Law in ancient Egypt By the 22nd century&nbsp;BC, the ancient Sumerian ruler Ur-Nammu had formulated the first law code, which consisted of casuistic statements ("if ... then ..."). Around 1760&nbsp;BC, King Hammurabi further developed Babylonian law, by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as stelae, for the entire public to see; this became known as the Codex Hammurabi. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully transliterated and translated into various languages, including English, German, and French.Richardson, Hammurabi''s Laws, 11The Old Testament dates back to 1280&nbsp;BC, and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small Greek city-state, Ancient Athens, and from about 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry; excluding women and the slave class. However, Athens had no legal science, and no word for "law" as an abstract concept.Kelly, A Short History of Western Legal Theory, 5\u20136 Yet Ancient Greek law contained major constitutional innovations in the development of democracy.Ober, The Nature of Athenian Democracy, 121Roman law was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists, and were highly sophisticated.Kelly, A Short History of Western Legal Theory, 39Stein, Roman Law in European History, 1 Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the Roman Empire, law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations, and underwent major codification during Justinian I.As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe, and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, Roman Law in European History, 2, 104\u2013107). Although it declined in significance during the Dark Ages, Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medi\u00e6val legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. In medi\u00e6val England, the King''s judges developed a body of precedent, which later became the common law. A Europe-wide Lex Mercatoria was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice; rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Lex Mercatoria, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom of contract and alienability of property.Sealey-Hooley, Commercial Law, 14 As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, Lex Mercatoria was incorporated into countries'' local law under new civil codes. The French Napoleonic Code and the German became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.Mattei, Comparative Law and Economics, 71 EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the European Court of Justice.Ancient India and China represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The Arthashastra, probably compiled around 100&nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the Manusmriti (c.&nbsp;100\u2013300&nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, Manu''s Code of Law, 18-25. Manu''s central philosophy was tolerance and Pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 276 This Hindu tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the British Empire.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 273 Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and Hong Kong also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 287 Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the French, but mostly the German Civil Code.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 304 This partly reflected Germany''s status as a rising power in the late 19th&nbsp;century. Similarly, traditional Chinese law gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the Ch''ing dynasty in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 305 Today Taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between Chiang Kai-shek''s nationalists, who fled there, and Mao Zedong''s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People''s Republic of China was heavily influenced by Soviet Socialist law, which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 307 Due to rapid industrialisation, today China undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World, 309 Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the World Trade Organisation.Farah, Five Years of China WTO Membership, 263\u2013304\u000aPhilosophy of law{{Main}}\u000a{{quote box}}The philosophy of law is commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence is essentially political philosophy, and asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?". John Austin''s utilitarian answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".Bix, John Austin Natural lawyers on the other side, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient Greek philosophy concurrently and in entanglement with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of Western culture through the writings of Thomas Aquinas.Hugo Grotius, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse\u2014as Aristotle had indicated\u2014and reason.Fritz Berolzheimer, The World''s Legal Philosophies, 115\u2013116 Immanuel Kant believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".Kant, Immanuel, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, 42 (par. 434) Jeremy Bentham and his student Austin, following David Hume, believed that this conflated the "is" and what "ought to be" problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law''s positivism; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".Green, Legal Positivism Kant was also criticised by Friedrich Nietzsche, who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the will to power, and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".Nietzsche, Zur Genealogie der Moral, Second Essay, 11Kazantzakis, Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law, 97\u201398Linarelli, Nietzsche in Law''s Cathedral, 23\u201326In 1934, the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the Pure Theory of Law.Marmor, The Pure Theory of Law Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity"; meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway is \u20ac500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (Grundnorm) instructing us to obey. Kelsen''s major opponent, Carl Schmitt, rejected both positivism and the idea of the rule of law because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.Finn, Constitutions in Crisis, 170\u2013171Later in the 20th century, H. L. A. Hart attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in The Concept of Law.Bayles, Hart''s Legal Philosophy, 21 Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart''s students continued the debate: In his book Law''s Empire, Ronald Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "interpretive concept",Dworkin, Law''s Empire, 410 that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. Joseph Raz, on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart''s "soft social thesis" approach in The Authority of Law.Raz, The Authority of Law, 3\u201336 Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to sociology, rather than jurisprudence.Raz, The Authority of Law, 37 etc.\u000aEconomic analysis of law{{Main}}In the 18th century Adam Smith presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.According to Malloy (Law and Economics, 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others". The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. antitrust law. The most influential proponents, such as Richard Posner and Oliver Williamson and the so-called Chicago School of economists and lawyers including Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, are generally advocates of deregulation and privatisation, and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of free markets.Jakoby, Economic Ideas and the Labour Market, 53The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs.Coase, The Nature of the Firm, 386\u2013405 Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, 1\u201344 Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this.Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, IV, 7 So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, V, 9 Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.Coase, The Problem of Social Cost, VIII, 23\u000aSociology of law{{Main}}Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, economic analysis of law and more specialised subjects such as criminology.Jary, Collins Dictionary of Sociology, 636 The institutions of social construction and legal frameworks are the relevant areas for the discipline''s inquiry. At first, legal theorists were suspicious of the discipline. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, Eugen Ehrlich, who sought to make distinct the differences between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of ''law'' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.Rottleuthner, La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne, 109Rottleuthner, Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts, 521Around 1900 Max Weber defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to people but to abstract norms.Rheinstein, Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society, 336 Legal rationalism was his term for a body of coherent and calculable law which formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism. Another sociologist, \u00c9mile Durkheim, wrote in The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.Johnson, The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156 Other notable early legal sociologists included Hugo Sinzheimer, Theodor Geiger, Georges Gurvitch and Leon Petra\u017cycki in Europe, and William Graham Sumner in the U.S.Gurvitch, Sociology of Law, 142Papachristou, Sociology of Law, 81\u201382\u000aLegal institutions{{quote box}}The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent courts, representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, bureaucratic organisation, the legal profession and civil society itself. John Locke, in his Two Treatises of Government, and Baron de Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws, advocated for a separation of powers between the political, legislature and executive bodies.Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6\u20137 Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the state, in contrast to the absolutist theory of Thomas Hobbes'' Leviathan.Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, XVII Max Weber and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens'' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people''s access to justice, whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law''s political basis.\u000aJudiciary{{Main}}A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this is the Supreme Court;A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court, Supreme Court of the United States in Australia, the High Court; in the UK, the Supreme Court;House of Lords Judgements, House of Lords in Germany, the Bundesverfassungsgericht; in France, the Cour de Cassation.Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, BundesverfassungsgerichtJurisprudence, publications, documentation, Cour de cassation For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the Council of Europe member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.Goldhaber, European Court of Human Rights, 1\u20132\u000aSome countries allow their highest judicial authority to over-rule legislation they determined as unconstitutional. In Roe v Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Texas law which forbade the granting of assistance to women seeking abortion.Roe v Wade (1973) 410 U.S. 113 Retrieved 2007-01-26 The U.S.''s constitution''s fourteenth amendment was interpreted to give Americans a right to privacy, and thus a woman''s right to choose abortion.A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, much as legislative bodies are. In most countries judges may only interpret the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the doctrine of precedent. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of parliamentary sovereignty, whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.Dicey, Law of the Constitution, 37\u201382 In communist states, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen\u2013Heller, Introduction, 11\u201312). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, Judiciary in the PRC, 282\u2013284 In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt may invalidate such laws,Sherif, Constitutions of Arab Countries, 158 and in Iran the Guardian Council ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".Rasekh, Islamism and Republicanism, 115\u2013116\u000aLegislature{{Main}}\u000aProminent examples of legislatures are the Houses of Parliament in London, the Congress in Washington D.C., the Bundestag in Berlin, the Duma in Moscow, the Parlamento Italiano in Rome and the Assembl\u00e9e nationale in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out their wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are unicameral, most countries are bicameral, meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses. In the ''lower house'' politicians are elected to represent smaller constituencies. The ''upper house'' is usually elected to represent states in a federal system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a house of review. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.Riker, The Justification of Bicameralism, 101To pass legislation, a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill (proposed law) in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution will be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). But in a presidential system, an executive appoints a cabinet to govern from his or her political allies whether or not they are elected (e.g. the United States or Brazil), and the legislature''s role is reduced to either ratification or veto.About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart\u2013Haggard, Presidential Systems, 67 etc.\u000aExecutive{{Main}}\u000aThe executive in a legal system serve as a government''s centre of political authority. In a parliamentary system, as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is chosen by the Prime Minister or Chancellor, whose office holds power under the confidence of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections. The head of state is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the German president (appointed by the Parliament); the Queen of the United Kingdom (a hereditary title), and the Austrian president (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the presidential system, found in France, the U.S. and Russia. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which is not accountable.Haggard, Presidents, Parliaments and Policy, 71Olson, The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe, 7Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for foreign relations, the military and police, and the bureaucracy. Ministers or other officials head a country''s public offices, such as a foreign ministry or interior ministry. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country''s approach to government.\u000aMilitary and police{{Main}}\u000aWhile military organizations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is relatively modern concept. Medi\u00e6val England''s system of traveling criminal courts, or assizes, used show trials and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.See, eg Tuberville v Savage (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you." The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of Louis XIV,History of Police Forces, History.com Encyclopedia although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world''s first uniformed policemen.Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix \u00e0 la Police de Proximit\u00e9, La Pr\u00e9fecture de PoliceWeber famously argued that the state is that which controls the legitimate monopoly of the means of violence.Weber, Politics as a VocationWeber, The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation, 154 The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term failed state refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, State-Building, 166\u2013167).\u000aBureaucracy{{Main}}\u000aThe etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (bureau) and the Ancient Greek for word "power" (kratos).Bureaucracy, Online Etymology Dictionary Like the military and police, a legal system''s government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by Baron de Grimm, a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and intendants are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.Albrow, Bureaucracy, 16\u000aCynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to private enterprise motivated by profit.Mises, Bureaucracy, II, Bureaucratic Management In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.Kettl, Public Bureaucracies, 367 Negative perceptions of "red tape" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power. Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.Weber, Economy and Society, I, 393 Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, management is composed of career experts, who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants'' discretion with rules.Kettl, Public Bureaucracies, 371\u000aLegal profession{{Main}}\u000aA corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to be able to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of an advocate in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary\u2014in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor (solicitor).Hazard\u2013Dondi, Legal Ethics, 1 As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom [1979] ECHR 1 at 49 Case no. 6538/74 In order to maintain professionalism, the practice of law is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a bar association, bar council or law society. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a Bachelor of Laws, a Bachelor of Civil Law or a Juris Doctor degreeHigher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a Master of Laws, a Master of Legal Studies or a Doctor of Laws.), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment (being admitted to the bar). Most Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.Ahamd, Lawyers: Islamic Law In China and other developing countries there are not enough law-trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.Hazard\u2013Dondi, Legal Ethics, 22\u201323Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a law firm, in a chambers as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal counsel. In addition a lawyer may become a legal researcher who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or through freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely. Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring case-law reports, legal periodicals and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court pleadings, persuasive briefs, contracts, or wills and trusts. Negotiation and dispute resolution skills (including ADR techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.Fine, The Globalisation of Legal Education, 364\u000aCivil society{{Main}}\u000aClassical republican concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.Warren, Civil Society, 3\u20134 Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."Locke, Second Treatise, Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87 German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (burgerliche Gesellschaft) in Elements of the Philosophy of Right.Hegel, Elements of the Philosophy of Right, 3, II, 182; Karkatsoulis, The State in Transition, 277\u2013278 Hegel believed that civil society and the state were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state\u2013civil society was reproduced in the theories of Alexis de Tocqueville and Karl Marx.(Pelczynski, The State and Civil Society, 1\u201313; Warren, Civil Society, 5\u20139){{cite journal}} Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author Geoffrey Robertson QC wrote of international law,... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.Robertson, Crimes Against Humanity, 98\u201399\u000aFreedom of speech, freedom of association and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a deliberative democracy is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and legitimate the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, debating clubs, non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the European Economic and Social Committee) exclude the political parties.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(31,0,'{{sociology}}\u000aThe middle class are any class in the middle of a societal hierarchy. In Weberian socio-economic terms, the middle class is the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the working class and upper class. In Marxist terms, middle class commonly refers to either the bourgeoisie before or during capitalism{{Citation needed}}, or some emergent new class within capitalism. In common parlance, middle class refers to a set of culturally distinct contemporary Western cultures that emphasize consumerism and property ownership within capitalism. Middle class citizens traditionally hold conservative politic views, often becoming registered conservative voters.\u000aHistory and evolution of the termThe term "middle class" has a long history {{Citation needed}}and has had several, sometimes contradictory, meanings.  It was once defined by exception as an intermediate social class between the nobility and the peasantry of Europe.{{By whom}}  While the nobility owned the countryside, and the peasantry worked the countryside, a new bourgeoisie (literally "town-dwellers") arose around mercantile functions in the city. Another definition equated the middle class to the original meaning of capitalist: someone with so much capital that they could rival nobles. In France, the middle classes helped drive the French Revolution.\u000aGeorges Lefebvre, La R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise, 1951 1957The modern sociological usage of the term "middle class," however, dates to the 1911 UK Registrar-General''s report, in which the statistician T.H.C. Stevenson identified the middle class as that falling between the upper class and the working class. Included as belonging to the middle class are professionals, managers, and senior civil servants. The chief defining characteristic of membership middle class is possession of significant human capital.Within capitalism, middle class initially referred to the bourgeoisie and petit bourgeoisie.  However, with the immiserisation and proletarianisation of much of the petit bourgeois world, and the growth of finance capitalism, middle class came to refer to the combination of labour aristocracy, professionals and white collar workers.The size of the middle class depends on how it is defined, whether by education, wealth, environment of upbringing, social network, manners or values, etc.  These are all related, though far from deterministically dependent.  The following factors are often ascribed in modern usage to a "middle class":{{By whom}}\u000a\u000aAchievement of tertiary education.\u000aHolding professional qualifications, including academics, lawyers, engineers, politicians and doctors regardless of their leisure or wealth.\u000aBelief in bourgeois values, such as high rates of house ownership and jobs which are perceived to be &#34;secure.&#34;\u000aLifestyle.  In the United Kingdom, social status has historically been linked less directly to wealth than in the United States{{Citation needed}}, and has also been judged by pointers such as accent, manners, place of education, occupation and the class of a person&#39;s family, circle of friends and acquaintances.{{Citation needed}}\u000aCultural identification. Often in the United States, the middle class are the most eager participants in pop culture whereas the reverse is true in Britain http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article1955405.ece  Discusses middle class snobbery as regards popular culture..\u000aThe second generation of new immigrants will often enthusiastically forsake their traditional folk culture as a sign of having arrived in the middle class.{{Citation needed}}In the United States by the end of the twentieth century, more people identified themselves as middle class than as lower or "working" class (with insignificant numbers identifying themselves as upper class).{{Citation needed}} In contrast, in the United Kingdom, in recent surveys up to two-thirds of Britons identify themselves as working class.{{Citation needed}} The British Labour Party, which grew out of the organized labour movement and originally drew almost all of its support from the working class, reinvented itself under Tony Blair in the 1990s as "New Labour," a party competing with the Conservative Party for the votes of the middle class as well as the working class.\u000aGeographic terms{{Original research}}\u000aGeographic terms such as "Heartland America", "Middle America" and "Middle England" are used to refer to a concept of the middle class of a country being located in the centre of that country.\u000aMiddle America\u000aMiddle America suggests a small town or suburb in the United States where people are predominantly middle class. The economy of Middle America is traditionally considered agricultural, though most Middle Americans now live in suburban locales, and a person may hold Middle American values while not living geographically in the Midwestern United States, and vice versa.\u000a{{cite news}}\u000aTime: Middle Americans\u000aThe phrase Middle American values refers to more traditional or conservative politics like family values.  There are many people who object to the notion that one group or subgroup of Americans defines its values or defines proper family values.\u000aMiddle EnglandThough Middle England more commonly denotes the middle class of non-urban England, it also has connotations of "Deep England". The BBC described the Kentish town of Tunbridge Wells as the "spiritual home" of Middle England;\u000a{{cite}} correspondents on a rather insular outdated idea of England are often parodied by signing letters Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells.\u000aMarxism and the middle classIn Marxism, which defines social classes according to their relationship with the means of production, the middle class is generally   synonymous with the remaining vestiges of the petit bourgeoisie, primarily composed of small business owners and the self-employed, as well as individuals occupying managerial and supervisory positions entailing the assumption of discretionary authority over the hiring and firing of subordinate labor. Historically, under feudalism, the bourgeoisie was represented by the urban merchant and professional class who stood between the aristocracy and the laboring classes, and thus, for a time, constituted a "middle class" as positioned in relation to the ruling and producing classes of the era. Later having, itself, matured to the position of ruling class throughout the developed nations of the modern world, the bourgeoisie''s inherently continuous need to generate greater levels of market expansion and productivity, has and must invariably lead the system''s trajectory to become further characterized by the steadily increasing concentration of capital, thereby correspondingly squelching the market share of small and independent proprietors, and displacing them into the evermore preponderant ranks of the working class. Consequently, Marx generally identified the modern middle class as an antiquated and dwindling social relic of the era preceding mass production, while characterizing all the endeavors aimed at preserving its own separate class position, relative to those of the modern working and ruling classes, as being predicated upon an inherently reactionary and historically obsoleted aspiration. Marxists vigorously debate the exact composition of the middle class under capitalism.  Some describe a "co-ordinating class" which implements capitalism on behalf of the capitalists, composed of the petit bourgeoisie, professionals and managers.{{Citation needed}} Others dispute this, freely using the term "middle class" to refer to affluent white-collar workers as described above (even though, in Marxist terms, they are part of the proletariat&mdash;the working class).{{Citation needed}} Still others (for example, council communists and  advocates of participatory economics) allege that there is a class comprising intellectuals, technocrats and managers that seeks power in its own right.{{Citation needed}} This last group allege that such technocratic middle classes seized power and government for themselves in Soviet-style societies (See co-ordinatorism).{{Citation needed}}\u000aRecent growth of the global middle classIn February 2009, the Economist magazine announced that over half the world''s population now belongs to the middle class, as a result of rapid growth in emerging countries. It characterized the middle class as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income, so that they do not live from hand to mouth as the poor do, and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter. This allows people to buy consumer goods, improve their health care, and provide for their children\u2019s education. Most of the emerging middle class consists of people who are middle-class by the standards of the developing world but not the rich one, since their money incomes do not match developed country levels, but the percentage of it which is discretionary does. By this definition, the number of middle class people in Asia exceeded that in the West sometime around 2007 or 2008.{{Citation}}The Economist article pointed out that in many emerging countries the middle class has not grown incrementally, but explosively. The rapid growth results from the fact that the majority of the people fall into the middle of a right-skewed bell-shaped curve, and when the peak of the population curve crosses the threshold into the middle class, the number of people in the middle class grows enormously. In addition, when the curve crosses the threshold, economic forces cause the bulge to become taller as incomes at that level grow faster than incomes in other ranges. The point at which the poor start entering the middle class by the millions is the time when poor countries get the maximum benefit from cheap labour through international trade, before they price themselves out of world markets for cheap goods. It is also a period of rapid urbanization, when subsistence farmers abandon marginal farms to work in factories, resulting in a several-fold increase in their economic productivity before their wages catch up to international levels. That stage was reached in China some time between 1990 and 2005, when the middle class grew from 15% to 62% of the population, and is just being reached in India now.The Economist predicted that surge across the poverty line should continue for a couple of decades and the global middle class will grow enormously between now and 2030.\u000aProfessional-managerial classBarbara Ehrenreich and her husband John defined a distinct part of the middle class in 1977 as "salaried mental workers who do not own the means of production and whose major function in the social division of labor...(is)...the reproduction of capitalist culture and capitalist class relations"; and they named this group the "professional-managerial class".\u000aStewart Clegg, Paul Boreham, Geoff Dow; {{cite book}} This group\u000aof middle class professionals are distinguished from the rest of the class by training and education (typically business qualifications and university degrees),\u000aPhilip Green, {{cite book}} with example occupations including academics and teachers, social workers, engineers, managers, nurses, and middle-level administrators.\u000a{{cite book}} The Ehrenreichs developed their definition from studies by Andr\u00e9 Gorz, Serge Mallet, and others, of a "new working class", which, despite education and a perception of themselves as being middle class, were part of the working class because they did not own the means of production, and were wage earners paid to produce a piece of capital.\u000a{{cite book}} The professional-managerial class seeks higher rank status and salary,\u000a{{cite book}} and tend to have incomes above the average for their country.\u000aGail Paradise Kelly, Sheila Slaughter; {{cite book}}\u000aConfusion surrounding the termA persistent source of confusion surrounding the term "middle class" derives predominantly from there being no set criteria for such a definition. From an economic perspective, for example, members of the middle class do not necessarily fall in the middle of a society''s income distribution. Instead, middle class salaries tend to be determined by middle class occupations, which in turn are attained by means of middle class values. Thus, individuals who might fall in the middle ground on a societal hierarchy as defined by sociologists do not necessarily fall into a middle ground on an economic hierarchy as defined by economists. As a result, intuitive colloquial and journalistic usage of the term casts a wide net and does not necessarily coincide with an academic sociological or economic definition.\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aMiddle class squeeze\u000aLower middle class\u000aUpper middle class\u000aAmerican middle class\u000aBlack middle class\u000a\u000aOther:\u000a\u000aBourgeoisie\u000aClasslessness\u000aPolitical donor class\u000aThe Lonely Crowd\u000aStatus paradox of migration\u000aProducerism\u000aXiaozi\u000aMiddle Class Millionaire\u000aEssex man\u000aLittle Englander\u000aWorcester woman\u000aDeep England\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences\u000aNotes{{Reflist}}\u000aBibliography\u000a\u000aBrian W.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(32,0,'{{Multiple issues}}\u000a{{Merge from}}{{Nationalism sidebar}}\u000aNationalism involves a strong identification of a group of individuals with a political entity defined in national terms, i.e. a nation. Often, it is the belief that an ethnic group has a right to statehood {{cite book}}, or that citizenship in a state should be limited to one ethnic group, or that multinationality in a single state should necessarily comprise the right to express and exercise national identity even by minorities {{cite book}}. It can also include the belief that the state is of primary importance, or the belief that one state is naturally superior to all other states.{{cite book}}Ernest Gellner and John Breuilly, Nations and Nationalism, "In brief, nationalism is a theory of political legitimacy, which requires that ethnic boundaries should not cut across political ones.", p. 1, Cornell University Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0801475009 It is also used to describe a movement to establish or protect a homeland (usually an autonomous state) for an ethnic group.  In some cases the identification of a national culture is combined with a negative view of other races or cultures.Thomas Blank and Peter Schmidt, National Identity in a United Germany: Nationalism or Patriotism? An Empirical Test with Representative Data, in Political Psychology, Vol. 24, No. 2, (2003) Conversely, nationalism might also be portrayed as collective identities towards imagined communities which are not naturally expressed in language, race or religion but rather socially constructed by the very individuals that belong to a given nation. {{cite book}} Nationalism is sometimes reactionary, calling for a return to a national past, and sometimes for the expulsion of foreigners. Other forms of nationalism are revolutionary, calling for the establishment of an independent state as a homeland for an ethnic underclass.Nationalism emphasizes collective identity - a ''people'' must be autonomous, united, and express a single national culture.{{cite book}} However, some nationalists stress individualism as an important part of their own national identity.Anthony D. Smith, Nationalism, p. 17-20, Polity, 2002, ISBN 978-0745626598.National flags, national anthems, and other symbols of national identity are often considered sacred, as if they were religious rather than political symbols.

Comparative Study of Fascism" by Juan J. Linz. Fascism, A Reader''s Guide: Analyses, interpretations, Bibliography. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1976. Pp. 15 "Fascism is above all a nationalist movement and therefore wherever the nation and the state are strongly identified."Laqueur, Walter. Fascism: Past, Present, Future. Oxford University Press, 1997. Pp. 90.

Accessed from the Jewish Virtual Library on February 5, 2009. http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Goebbels091038.html Joseph Goebbels describes the Nazis as being allied with countries which had "authoritarian nationalist" ideology and conception of the state "It enables us to see at once why democracy and Bolshevism, which in the eyes of the world are irrevocably opposed to one another, meet again and again on common ground in their joint hatred of and attacks on authoritarian nationalist concepts of State and State systems. For the authoritarian nationalist conception of the State represents something essentially new. In it the French Revolution is superseded.".Koln, Hans; Calhoun, Craig. The Idea of Nationalism: A Study in its Origins and Background. Transaction Publishers. Pp 20.University of California. 1942. Journal of Central European Affairs. Volume 2.\u000aVarieties\u000aNational purity\u000aSome nationalists exclude certain groups.  They view people who are, in fact, citizens of their nation, as being not really citizens, in some sense, and therefore not protected by the rights afforded "real" citizens.  Sometimes a mythic homeland is more important for the national identity than the actual territory occupied by the nation.Smith, Anthony D. 1986. The Ethnic Origins of Nations London: Basil Blackwell. pp 6\u201318. ISBN 0-631-15205-9.\u000aCivic nationalismCivic nationalism defines the nation as an association of people with equal and shared political rights, and allegiance to similar political procedures.{{Citation}} According to the principles of civic nationalism the nation is not based on common ethnic ancestry, but is a political entity, whose core is not ethnicity. This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by Ernest Renan in his lecture in 1882 "Where is the nation?", where he defined the nation as a "daily plebiscite dependent on the will of its people to continue living together".Civic nationalism (or civil nationalism) is the form of nationalism in which the state derives political legitimacy from the active participation of its citizenry, from the degree to which it represents the "will of the people". It is often seen as originating with Jean-Jacques Rousseau and especially the social contract theories which take their name from his 1762 book The Social Contract. Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of rationalism and liberalism, but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with ethnic nationalism. Membership of the civic nation is considered voluntary. Civic-national ideals influenced the development of representative democracy in countries such as the United States and France.\u000aEthnocentrismWhereas nationalism does not necessarily imply a belief in the superiority of one ethnicity over others, some nationalists support ethnocentric protectionism or ethnocentric supremacy. Studies have yielded evidence that such behaviour may be derived from innate preferences in humans from infancy{{Citation}}.In the USA for example, non-indigenous ethnocentric nationalist movements {{Clarify}} exist for both black and white peoples. These forms of "nationalism" often promote or glorify foreign nations that they believe can serve as an example for their own nation, see Anglophilia or Afrocentrism.Explicit biological race theory was influential from the end of the 19th century.  Nationalist and Fascist movements in the first half of the 20th century often appealed to these theories.{{Clarify}}  The National Socialist ideology was amongst the most comprehensively "racial" ideologies: the concept of "race" influenced aspects of policy in Nazi Germany.\u000aIn the 21st century the term "race" is no longer regarded by many people as a meaningful term to describe the range of human phenotype clusters{{Clarify}}; the term ethnocentrism is a more accurate and meaningful term{{Citation}} ISBN 9780805848571.Ethnic cleansing is often seen as both a nationalist and ethnocentrist phenomenon.  It is part of nationalist logic that the state is reserved for one nation, but not all nationalist nation-states expel their minorities.\u000aExpansionist nationalismExpansionist nationalism promotes expansion into new territories, usually with the claim that the existing territory is too small or is not able to physically or economically sustain the nation''s population.  One example of this is Adolf Hitler''s territorial demands.\u000aLeft-wing nationalismLeft-wing nationalism (occasionally known as socialist nationalism)Political Science, Volume 35, Issue 2; Class and Nation: Problems of Socialist Nationalism refers to any political movement that combines left-wing politics with nationalism.\u000aMany nationalist movements are dedicated to national liberation, in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self-determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors. Anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninism is closely tied with this ideology, and practical examples include Stalin''s early work Marxism and the National Question and his Socialism in One Country edict, which declares that nationalism can be used in an internationalist context, fighting for national liberation without racial or religious divisions. Other examples of left-wing nationalism include Fidel Castro''s 26th of July Movement that launched the Cuban Revolution ousting the American-backed Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Ireland''s Sinn F\u00e9in, the Awami League in Bangladesh and the African National Congress in South Africa.\u000aTerritorial nationalism{{Main}}\u000aTerritorial nationalist assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption.Middle East and North Africa: Challenge to Western Security by Peter Duignan and L.H. Gann, Hoover Institution Press, 1981, ISBN 978-0817973926 (page 22) A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes.Encyclopaedia of Nationalism by Athena S.

Volume 2. which promotes national revolution, national collectivism, a totalitarian state, and irredentism or expansionism to unify and allow the growth of a nation. Fascists often promote ethnic nationalism but have at times promoted cultural nationalism, including cultural assimilation of people outside a specific ethnic group. Fascism stresses the subservience of the individual to the state, and the need to absolute and unquestioned loyalty to a strong ruler.Roger Griffin, Fascism, Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN 978-0192892492.\u000aCriticism{{Main}}\u000aCritics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a ''nation'', or why a nation should be the only legitimate unit of political rule. A nation is a cultural entity, and not necessarily a political association, nor is it necessarily linked to a particular territorial area - although nationalists argue that the boundaries of a nation and a state should, as far as possible, coincide.{{cite book}} Philosopher A.C. Grayling describes nations as artificial constructs, "their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars". He argues that "there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity".{{cite book}}Nationalism is inherently divisive because it highlights differences between peoples, emphasizing an individual''s identification with their own nation. The idea is also potentially oppressive because it submerges individual identity within a national whole, and gives elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control the masses.{{cite book}}\u000aMuch of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. Even in that early stage, however, there was an ideological critique of nationalism. That has developed into several forms of anti-nationalism in the western world. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamic critique of the nation-state.At the end of the 19th century, Marxists and other socialists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in central and eastern Europe (though a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from Lenin (a communist) to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national self-determination){{cite web}}. Most sociological theories of nationalism date from after the Second World War.In the liberal political tradition there is widespread criticism of \u2018nationalism\u2019 as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. Nationalism has often been exploited to encourage citizens to partake in the nations conflicts. Such examples include The Great War and World War Two, where nationalism was a key component of propaganda material. Liberals do not generally dispute the existence of the nation-states. The liberal critique also emphasizes individual freedom as opposed to national identity, which is by definition collective (see collectivism).The pacifist critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated militarism, and on conflicts between nations inspired by jingoism or chauvinism. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. Famous pacifist Bertrand Russell criticizes nationalism of diminishing individual''s capacity to judge his or her fatherland''s foreign policy.Russell Speaks His Mind, 1960. Fletcher and son Ltd., Norwich, United Kingdom  William Blum has said this in other words: "If love is blind, patriotism has lost all five senses."Blum in his book Rogue State{{pn}}  Albert Einstein stated that "Nationalism is an infantile disease... It is the measles of mankind." Einstein http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins107012.htmlThe anti-racist critique of nationalism concentrates on the attitudes to other nations, and especially on the doctrine that the nation-state exists for one national group to the exclusion of others. This view emphasizes the chauvinism and xenophobia that have often resulted from nationalist sentiment. Norman Naimark relates the rise of nationalism to ethnic cleansing and genocide, including the Armenian Genocide, the Nazi Holocaust, the deportation of Chechens and Crimean Tartars under Stalin, the expulsion of Germans from Poland and Czechoslovakia at the end of the Second World War, and the ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.{{cite web}}Political movements of the left have often been suspicious of nationalism, again without necessarily seeking the disappearance of the existing nation-states. Marxism has been ambiguous towards the nation-state, and in the late 19th century some Marxist theorists rejected it completely. For some Marxists the world revolution implied a global state (or global absence of state); for others it meant that each nation-state had its own revolution. A significant event in this context was the failure of the social-democratic and socialist movements in Europe to mobilize a cross-border workers'' opposition to World War I. At present most, but certainly not all, left-wing groups accept the nation-state, and see it as the political arena for their activities.Anarchism has developed a critique of nationalism that focuses on its role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifiying goal it strives for centralization both in specific terrotories and in a ruling elite of individuals while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism this subject has been trated extensively by Rudolf Rocker in Nationalism and Culture and by the works of Fredy Perlman such as Against His-Story, Against Leviathan and "The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism".In the Western world, the most comprehensive current ideological alternative to nationalism is cosmopolitanism.  Ethical cosmopolitanism rejects one of the basic ethical principles of nationalism: that humans owe more duties to a fellow member of the nation, than to a non-member.  It rejects such important nationalist values as national identity and national loyalty. However, there is also a political cosmopolitanism, which has a geopolitical program to match that of nationalism: it seeks some form of world state, with a world government.  Very few people openly and explicitly support the establishment of a global state, but political cosmopolitanism has influenced the development of international criminal law, and the erosion of the status of national sovereignty. In turn, nationalists are deeply suspicious of cosmopolitan attitudes, which they equate with eradication of diverse national cultures.While internationalism in the cosmopolitan context by definition implies cooperation among nations and states, and therefore the existence of nations, proletarian internationalism is different, in that it calls for the international working class to follow its brethren in other countries irrespective of the activities or pressures of the national government of a particular sector of that class. Meanwhile, most (but not all) anarchists reject nation-states on the basis of self-determination of the majority social class, and thus reject nationalism. Instead of nations, anarchists usually advocate the creation of cooperative societies based on free association and mutual aid without regard to ethnicity or race.\u000aSee also{{Portal box}}\u000a\u000aAnti-nationalism\u000aNation state\u000aHistoriography and nationalism\u000aLeft-wing nationalism\u000aNationalism and sport\u000aPatriotism\u000aJingoism\u000aStatism\u000aNeo-nationalism\u000a\u000aLists:\u000a\u000aList of active autonomist and secessionist movements\u000aList of historical autonomist and secessionist movements\u000aList of nationalist conflicts\u000aList of nationalist organizations\u000aList of prominent figures in nationalism\u000a\u000a\u000aNotes{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading\u000aGeneral\u000a\u000aBreuilly, John. 1994.

The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as mother tongue) are Nepali (48.61%), Maithili (12.30%), Bhojpuri (7.53%), Tharu (5.86%), Tamang (5.19%), Newari/Nepal Bhasa (3.63%), Magar (3.39%), Awadhi (2.47%), Rai (2.79%), Limbu (1.47%), and Bajjika (1.05%).Derived from Sanskrit, Nepali has roots in Sanskrit and is written in Devanagari script. Nepali is the official national language and serves as lingua franca among Nepalis of different ethnolinguistic groups. Hindi and related regional dialects Awadhi, Bhojpuri and Maithili are spoken in the southern Terai Region.  Hindi is also widely understood by the many Nepalis who have lived in India. Many Nepalis in government and business speak English as well.  Dialects of Tibetan are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education.

Around 1000 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the region. From one of these, the Shakya confederation, arose a prince named Siddharta Gautama (563\u2013483 BC), who later renounced his royalty to lead an ascetic life and came to be known as the Buddha ("the enlightened one"). The 7th Kirata king, Jitedasti, was on the throne in the Nepal valley at the time. By 250 BC, the region came under the influence of the Mauryan Empire of northern India, and later became a vassal state under the Gupta Empire in the fourth century AD. In the fifth century, rulers called the Licchavis governed the majority of its area.

Reprint: Mushiram Manoharlal Publishers, New Delhi. 1973.The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century and was followed by a Newari era, from 879, although the extent of their control over the entire country is uncertain. By the late 11th century, southern Nepal came under the influence of the Chalukaya Empire of southern India. Under the Chalukayas, Nepal''s religious establishment changed as the kings patronised Hinduism instead of the prevailing Buddhism.\u000aMedievalBy the early 12th century, leaders were emerging whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix malla ("wrestler"). Initially their reign was marked by upheaval, but the kings consolidated their power and ruled over the next 200 years; by the late 14th century, much of the country began to come under a unified rule. This unity was short-lived; in 1482 the region was carved into three kingdoms: Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur.\u000aKingdom of Nepal{{Main}}\u000aAfter centuries of petty rivalry between the three kingdoms, in the mid-18th century, Prithvi Narayan Shah, a Gorkha King, set out to unify the kingdoms. Seeking arms and aid from India, and buying the neutrality of bordering Indian kingdoms, he embarked on his mission in 1765. After several bloody battles and sieges, he managed to unify the Kathmandu Valley three years later in 1768. However, an actual battle never took place to conquer the Kathmandu valley; it was taken over by Prithvi Narayan and his troops without any effort, during Indra Jatra, a festival of Newars, when all the valley''s citizens were celebrating the festival. This event marked the birth of the modern nation of Nepal.In 1788 the Nepalese overran Sikkim and sent a punitive raid into Tibet. Kangra in northern India was also occupied by the Nepalese. In 1809, Ranjit Singh the ruler of the Sikh state in the Punjab, had intervened and drove the Nepalese army east of the Satluj river."The Enclosing of Nepal". Countrystudies.us. Source: U.S. Library of Congress.At its maximum extent, Greater Nepal extended from the Tista River in the east, to Kangara, across the Sutlej River in the west as well as further south into the Terai plains and north of the Himalayas than at present.  A dispute and subsequent war with Tibet over the control of mountain passes forced the Nepalese to retreat and pay heavy reparations to China.Rivalry between Nepal and the British East India Company over the annexation of minor states bordering Nepal eventually led to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1815\u201316). At first the British underestimated the Nepalese and were badly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing.  They were greatly impressed by the valor and competence of their adversaries.  Thus began the reputation of "Gurkhas" as fierce and ruthless soldiers.  The war ended in the Treaty of Sugauli, under which Nepal ceded recently captured portions of Sikkim and lands in Terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers.Factionalism inside the royal family had led to a period of instability. In 1846 a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Rana, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the Kot Massacre; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Jung Bahadur Rana emerged victorious and founded the Rana lineage.The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the Indian Sepoy Rebellion in 1857 (and later in both World Wars). Some parts of the Terai Region were given back to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture, because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the Sepoy Rebellion. In 1923, the United Kingdom and Nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship, in which Nepal''s independence was recognized by the UK.Slavery was abolished in Nepal in 1924.Tucci, Giuseppe.

Nevertheless debt bondage even involving debtors'' children has been a persistent social problem in the Terai.In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Meanwhile, with the assertion of Chinese control in Tibet in the 1950s, India sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in Nepal. India sponsored both King Tribhuvan (ruled 1911-55) as Nepal''s new ruler in 1951 and a new government, mostly comprising the Nepali Congress Party, thus terminating Rana hegemony in the kingdom.After years of power wrangling between the king and the government, King Mahendra (ruled 1955-72) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959, and a "partyless" panchayat system was made to govern Nepal until 1989, when the "Jan Andolan" (People''s Movement) forced King Birendra (ruled 1972-2001)  to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in May 1991.{{cite news}} In 1991\u201392, Bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 ethnic Nepalis, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since.In 1996, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people''s socialist republic by violent means. This led to the long Nepal Civil War and more than 12,000 deaths. On June 1, 2001, there was a massacre in the royal palace. King Birendra, Queen Aiswarya, Crown Prince Dipendra and seven other members of the royal family were killed.  Dipendra was accused of patricide and of committing suicide thereafter.  This outburst was alleged to have been Dipendra''s response to his parents'' refusal to accept his choice of wife. Nevertheless there are speculation and doubts among Nepalese citizens about who was responsible.Following the carnage, Birendra''s brother Gyanendra inherited the throne. On February 1, 2005, Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent Maoist movement, but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed where the Maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside yet could not dislodge the military numerous towns and the largest cities.  In September 2005, the Maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate.In response to the 2006 democracy movement King Gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people.  On April 24, 2006 the dissolved House of Representatives was reinstated.  Using its newly acquired sovereign authority, on May 18, 2006 the House of Representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared Nepal a secular state, ending its time-honoured official status as a Hindu Kingdom. On December 28, 2007, a bill was passed in parliament to amend Article 159 of the constitution&nbsp;\u2014 replacing "Provisions regarding the King" by "Provisions of the Head of the State" - declaring Nepal a federal republic, and thereby abolishing the monarchy.Nepal votes to abolish monarchy - CNN{{Dead link}} The bill came into force on May 28, 2008, as the constituent assembly overwhelmingly voted to abolish royal rule.{{cite news}}\u000aRepublicThe Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) won the largest number of seats in the Constituent Assembly election held on April 10, 2008, and formed a coalition government which included most of the parties in the CA. Although acts of violence occurred during the pre-electoral period, election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and "well-carried out."{{cite web}}The newly elected Assembly met in Kathmandu on May 28, 2008, and, after a polling of 564 constituent Assembly members, 560 voted to form a new government,http://www.kantipuronline.com/kolnews.php?nid=148454 with the monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which had four members in the assembly, registering a dissent note. At that point, it was declared that Nepal had become a secular and inclusive democratic republic,{{Cite news}} with the government announcing a three-day public holiday from May 28 to 30. The King was thereafter given 15 days to vacate the Narayanhiti Royal Palace, to re-open it as a public museum.Nonetheless, political tensions and consequent power-sharing battles have continued in Nepal. In May 2009, the Maoist-led government was toppled and another coalition government with all major political parties barring the Maoists was formed. Madhav Kumar Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) was made the Prime Minister of the coalition government.\u000aGeography\u000a{{Main}}\u000aGeography of Nepal is uncommonly diverse. Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, {{convert}} long and {{convert}} wide, with an area of {{convert}}. See List of territories by size for the comparative size of Nepal.Nepal is commonly divided into three physiographic areas: the Mountain, Hill, Siwalik region and Terai Regions. These ecological belts run east-west and are vertically intersected by Nepal''s major, north to south flowing river systems.The southern lowland plains or Terai bordering India are part of the northern rim of the Indo-Gangetic plains. They were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the Kosi, the Narayani, and the Karnali as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of foothills called Shiwalik or Churia Range cresting at {{convert}} marks the limit of the Gangetic Plain, however broad, low valleys called Inner Tarai (Bhitri Tarai Uptyaka) lie north of these foothills in several places.\u000a\u000aThe Hill Region (Pahad) abuts the mountains and varies from {{convert}} in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below {{convert}} to alpine climates above {{convert}}.  The Mahabharat Lekh reaching {{convert}} is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and "hills" alternating to the north of this range.  Population density is high in valleys but notably less above {{convert}} and very low above {{convert}} where snow occasionally falls in winter.The Mountain Region (Parbat), situated in the Great Himalayan Range, makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including {{convert}} height Mount Everest (Sagarmatha in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world''s eight thousand metre peaks are in Nepal or on its border with China: Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Kanchenjunga, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna and Manaslu.Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and subtropical zones lie below {{convert}}, the temperate zone {{convert}}, the cold zone {{convert}}, the subarctic zone {{convert}}, and the Arctic zone above {{convert}}.Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, monsoon, autumn, winter and spring. The Himalaya blocks cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns. In a land once thickly forested, deforestation is a major problem in all regions, with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems.Nepal is popular for mountaineering, containing some of the highest and most challenging mountains in the world, including Mount Everest. Technically, the south-east ridge on the Nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb; so, most climbers prefer to trek to Everest through Nepal. Morever Nepal has 8 of the top 10 highest mountains of the world with postcard beauty.\u000aEnvironmentThe dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal result in a variety of biomes, from tropical savannas along the Indian border, to subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the Hill Region, to temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests on the slopes of the Himalaya, to montane grasslands and shrublands and rock and ice at the highest elevations.At the lowest elevations we find the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion. These form a mosaic with the Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests, which occur from {{convert}} and include the Inner Terai Valleys. Himalayan subtropical pine forests occur between {{convert}}.Above these elevations, the biogeography of Nepal is generally divided from east to west by the Gandaki River. Ecoregions to the east tend to receive more precipitation and to be more species-rich. Those to the west are drier with fewer species.From {{convert}}, we find temperate broadleaf forests: the eastern and western Himalayan broadleaf forests. From {{convert}} are the eastern and western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. To {{convert}} are the eastern and western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows.\u000aSubdivisions\u000a{{Main}}\u000aNepal is divided into 14 zones and 75 districts, grouped into 5 development regions. Each district is headed by a permanent chief district officer responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries.

Given the great magnitudes of the blocks of the Earth''s crust involved, this is remarkably fast, about twice the speed at which human fingernails grow. As the strong Indian continental crust subducts beneath the relatively weak Tibetan crust, it pushes up the Himalayan mountains. This collision zone has accommodated huge amounts of crustal shortening as the rock sequences slide one over another.Erosion of the Himalayas is a very important source of sediment, which flows via several great rivers (the Indus to the Indian Ocean, and the Ganges and Brahmaputra river system) to the Bay of Bengal.Summerfield & Hulton, 1994; Hay, 1998.\u000aGovernment and politics{{Main}}\u000a\u000aNepal has seen rapid political changes during the last two decades. Until 1990, Nepal was a monarchy running under the executive control of the king. Faced with a Communist movement against the absolute monarchy, King Birendra, in 1990, agreed to large-scale political reforms by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the king as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of the government. Nepal has also been noted for its recent speed of development, such as being one of the few countries in Asia to abolish the death penalty{{cite web}} and the first country in Asia to rule in favor of same-sex marriage, which the government has a seven-person committee studying after a November 2008 ruling by the nation''s Supreme Court, which ordered full rights for LGBT individuals, including the right to marry.{{cite web}}Nepal''s legislature was bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives called the Pratinidhi Sabha and a National Council called the Rastriya Sabha. The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had 60 members: ten nominated by the king, 35 elected by the House of Representatives, and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers (the Cabinet). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal tended to be highly unstable, falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch, on the recommendation of the prime minister, according to the constitution; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991.The movement in April 2006 brought about a change in the nation''s governance: an interim constitution was promulgated, with the King giving up power, and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the Maoist rebels. The number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330. In April 2007, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) joined the interim government of Nepal.{{Prose}}On April 10, 2008, the first election in Nepal for the constitution assembly took place. The Maoist party led the poll results but failed to gain a simple majority in the parliament.{{cite news}}On December 10, 2007, the interim parliament passed a bill that would make Nepal a federal republic, with the Prime Minister becoming head of state. On May 28, 2008, lawmakers in Nepal legally abolished the monarchy and declared the country a republic, ending 239 years of royal rule in the Himalayan nation. The newly elected assembly, led by the former communist rebels, adopted the resolution at its first meeting by an overwhelming majority. King Gyanendra was given 15 days to leave the former Royal Palace in central Kathmandu by the Nepalese Constituent Assembly. He left the former Royal Palace on June 11.Nepal''s Lawmakers Abolish the Country''s Monarchy{{Dead link}}On June 26, 2008, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala tendered his resignation to the Nepalese Constituent Assembly, which is also functioning as the Nepalese Parliament; however, a new Prime Minister has yet to be elected by the Nepalese Constituent Assembly.On July 19, 2008, the first round of voting for the election of the country''s president and vice president took place in the Constituent Assembly. Parmanand Jha became the first vice president of Nepal. However, the two presidential frontrunners, Dr. Ram Baran Yadav of Nepali Congress and the Maoist-backed candidate Ram Raja Prasad Singh, both failed to gain the minimum 298 votes needed to be elected, with Yadav receiving 283 votes and Singh receiving 270. 578 out of 594 CA members registered in the voter list had cast their votes, of which 24 were invalid.On July 21, 2008, the second round of voting was held. Yadav received 308 of the 590 votes cast, securing his election as president.http://www.presidentofnepal.comOn August 15, 2008, Maoist leader Prachanda (Pushpa Kamal Dahal) was elected Prime Minister of Nepal, the first since the country''s transition from a monarchy to a republic. On May 4, 2009, Mr. Pushpa Kamal Dahal resigned over on-going conflicts over sacking of the Army chief.\u000aMilitary and foreign affairs{{Main}}Nepal''s military consists of the Nepalese Army, which includes the Nepalese Army Air Service (the air force unit under it.) Nepalese Police Force is the civilian police and the Armed Police Force Nepal{{cite web}} is the paramilitary force. Service is voluntary and the minimum age for enlistment is 18 years. Nepal spends $99.2 million (2004) on its military\u20141.5% of its GDP. Many of the equipment and arms are imported from India. Consequently, the USA provided M16s M4s and other Colt weapons to combat communist (Maoist) insurgents. As of now, the standard-issue battle rifle of the Nepalese army is the Colt M16.http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/rl31599.pdfNepal has close ties with both of its neighbours, India and China. In accordance with a long-standing treaty, Indian and Nepalese citizens may travel to each others'' countries without a passport or visa. Nepalese citizens may work in India without legal restriction. Although Nepal and India typically have close ties, from time to time Nepal becomes caught up in the problematic Sino-Indian relationship. Recently, China has been asking Nepal to curb protests in Nepal against China''s Policy on Tibet,{{cite news}} and on April 17, 2008, police arrested over 500 Tibetan protestors{{cite news}} citing a need to maintain positive relations with China.\u000aEconomy{{Main}}\u000aNepal''s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2008 was estimated at over US$12 billion (adjusted to Nominal GDP), making it the 115th-largest economy in the world. Agriculture accounts for about 40% of Nepal''s GDP, services comprise 41% and industry 22%. Agriculture employs 76% of the workforce, services 18% and manufacturing/craft-based industry 6%. Agricultural produce&nbsp;\u2014 mostly grown in the Terai region bordering India&nbsp;\u2014 includes tea, rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, root crops, milk, and water buffalo meat. Industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce, including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.Its workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labour. The spectacular landscape and diverse, exotic cultures of Nepal represent considerable potential for tourism, but growth in this hospitality industry has been stifled by recent political events. The rate of unemployment and underemployment approaches half of the working-age population. Thus many Nepali citizens move to India in search of work; the Gulf countries and Malaysia being new sources of work. Nepal receives US$50 million a year through the Gurkha soldiers who serve in the Indian and British armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery. The total remittance value is worth around US$1 billion, including money sent from the Persian Gulf and Malaysia, who combined employ around 700,000 Nepali citizens.A long-standing economic agreement underpins a close relationship with India. The country receives foreign aid from India, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, China, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries. Poverty is acute; per-capita income is less than US$470.{{cite web}} The distribution of wealth among the Nepalis is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%.The government''s budget is about US$1.153 billion, with expenditures of $1.789 billion (FY05/06). The Nepalese rupee has been tied to the Indian Rupee at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Since the loosening of exchange rate controls in the early 1990s, the black market for foreign exchange has all but disappeared. The inflation rate has dropped to 2.9% after a period of higher inflation during the 1990s.Nepal''s exports of mainly carpets, clothing, leather goods, jute goods and grain total $822 million. Import commodities of mainly gold, machinery and equipment, petroleum products and fertilizer total US$2 bn. India (53.7%), the US (17.4%), and Germany (7.1%) are its main export partners. Nepal''s import partners include India (47.5%), the United Arab Emirates (11.2%), China (10.7%), Saudi Arabia (4.9%), and Singapore (4%).Nepal remains isolated from the world''s major land, air and sea transport routes although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 48 airports, ten of them with paved runways; flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. There were just over {{convert}} of paved roads, and one 59-km railway line in the south in 2003. There is only one reliable road route from India to the Kathmandu Valley. The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Calcutta in India. Internally, the poor state of development of the road system (22 of 75 administrative districts lack road links) makes volume distribution unrealistic. Besides having landlocked, rugged geography, few tangible natural resources and poor infrastructure, the long-running civil war is also a factor in stunting the economic growth.{{cite encyclopedia}}There is less than one telephone per 19 people. Landline telephone services are not adequate nationwide but are concentrated in cities and district headquarters. Mobile telephony is in a reasonable state in most parts of the country with increased accessibility and affordability; there were around 175,000 Internet connections in 2005. After the imposition of the "state of emergency", intermittent losses of service-signals were reported, but uninterrupted Internet connections have resumed after Nepal''s second major people''s revolution to overthrow the King''s absolute power.{{cite web}}\u000aDemographics{{Main}}The Nepalese are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet, and North Burma and Yunnan via Assam.Among the earliest inhabitants were the Kirat of east mid-region, Newar of the Kathmandu Valley and aboriginal Tharu in the southern Terai region. The ancestors of the Brahman and Chetri caste groups came from India''s present Kumaon, Garhwal and Kashmir regions, while other ethnic groups trace their origins to North Burma and Yunnan and Tibet, e.g. the Gurung and Magar in the west, Rai and Limbu in the east (from Yunnan and north Burma via Assam), and Sherpa and Bhutia in the north (from Tibet).In the Terai, a part of the Ganges Basin with 20% of the land, much of the population is physically and culturally similar to the Indo-Aryans of northern India.

Buddhism is the dominant religion of the thinly populated northern areas, which are inhabited by Tibetan-related peoples, such as the Sherpa.The Buddha, born as a Hindu, is also said to be a descendant of Vedic Sage Angirasa in many Buddhist texts.The Life of Buddha as Legend and History, by Edward Joseph Thomas The Buddha''s family surname is associated with Gautama Maharishi.P. 95 A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms By James Legge Differences between Hindus and Buddhists have been minimal in Nepal due to the cultural and historical intermingling of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. Morever traditionally Buddhism and Hinduism were never two distinct religions in western sense of world. In Nepal, the faiths share common temples and worship common deities. Among other natives of Nepal, those more influenced by Hinduism were the Magar, Sunwar, Limbu and Rai and the Gurkhas. Hindu influence is less prominent among the Gurung, Bhutia, and Thakali groups who employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies. Most of the festivals in Nepal are Hindu.{{cite web}} The Machendrajatra festival, dedicated to Hindu Shaiva Siddha, is celebrated by many Buddhists in Nepal as a main festival.P. 885 Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 10 By James Hastings As it is believed that Ne Muni established Nepal,Wright, P. 107, History of Nepal: With an Introductory Sketch of the Country and People of Nepal some important priests in Nepal are called "Tirthaguru Nemuni".\u000aHealth{{Main}}\u000aThe fertility rate in Nepal was at 3.7 births per woman in the early 2000s.\u000a{{cite web}} Public expenditure on health was at 1.5 % of the GDP in 2004. Private expenditure on health was 4.1 % in 2004. In the early 2000s, there were 21 physicians per 100,000 people.\u000aInfant mortality was 56 per 1000 life births in 2005.\u000aCulture{{Main}}A typical Nepalese meal is dal-bhat-tarkari. Dal is a spicy lentil soup, served over bhat (boiled rice), served with tarkari (curried vegetables) together with achar (pickles) or chutni (spicy condiment made from fresh ingredients).. The Newar community, however, has its own unique cuisine. It consists of non-vegetarian as well as vegetarian items served with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Mustard oil is the cooking medium and a host of spices, such as cumin, coriander, black peppers, sesame seeds, turmeric, garlic, ginger, methi (fenugreek), bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, chillies, mustard seeds, etc., are used in the cooking. The cuisine served on festivals is generally the best.{{Main}}\u000aThe Newari Music orchestra consists mainly of percussion instruments, though wind instruments, such as flutes and other similar instruments, are also used. String instruments are very rare. There are songs pertaining to particular seasons and festivals. Paahan chare music is probably the fastest played music whereas the Dapa the slowest. There are certain musical instruments such as Dhimay and Bhusya which are played as instrumental only and are not accompanied with songs. The dhimay music is the loudest one. In the hills, people enjoy their own kind of music, playing saarangi (a string instrument), madal and flute. They also have many popular folk songs known as lok geet and lok dohari.The Newar dances can be broadly classified into masked dances and non-masked dances. The most representative of Newari dances is Lakhey dance. Almost all the settlements of Newaris organise Lakhey dance at least once a year, mostly in the Goonlaa month. So, they are called Goonlaa Lakhey. However, the most famous Lakhey dance is the Majipa Lakhey dance; it is performed by the Ranjitkars of Kathmandu and the celebration continues for the entire week that contains the full moon of Yenlaa month. The Lakhey are considered to be the saviors of children.Folklore is an integral part of Nepalese society. Traditional stories are rooted in the reality of day-to-day life, tales of love, affection and battles as well as demons and ghosts and thus reflect local lifestyles, cultures and beliefs. Many Nepalese folktales are enacted through the medium of dance and music.The Nepali year begins in mid-April and is divided into 12 months. Saturday is the official weekly holiday. Main annual holidays include the National Day, celebrated on the birthday of the king (December 28), Prithvi Jayanti (January 11), Martyr''s Day (February 18), and a mix of Hindu and Buddhist festivals such as dashain in autumn, and tihar in late autumn. During tihar, the Newar community also celebrates its New Year as per their local calendar Nepal Sambat.Most houses in rural lowland of Nepal are made up of a tight bamboo framework and walls of a mud and cow-dung mix. These dwellings remain cool in summer and retain warmth in winter. Houses in the hills are usually made of unbaked bricks with thatch or tile roofing. At high elevations construction changes to stone masonry and slate may be used on roofs.Nepal''s flag is the only national flag in the world that is non-quadrilateral in shape, and one of only two non-rectangular flags in use (the other being the flag of the U.S. state of Ohio). According to its official description, the red in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also color of the rhododendron, the national flower of Nepal. Red also stands for aggression. The flag''s blue border signifies peace. The curved moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepalese, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepalese warriors.\u000aEducationAbout two thirds of female adults and one third of male adults are illiterate.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(34,0,'{{Redirect}}A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a legally constituted organization created by natural or legal persons that operates independently from any government. In the cases in which NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments, the NGO maintains its non-governmental status by excluding government representatives from membership in the organization. The term is usually applied only to organizations that pursue some wider social aim that has political aspects, but that are not overtly political organizations such as political parties. Unlike the term "intergovernmental organization", the term "non-governmental organization" has no generally agreed legal definition. In many jurisdictions, these types of organization are called "civil society organizations" or referred to by other names.The number of internationally operating NGOs is estimated at 40,000.(Anheier et al., "Global Civil Society 2001", 2001) National numbers are even higher: Russia has 277,000 NGOs;Hobbled NGOs wary of Medvedev - - chicagotribune.com India is estimated to have around 1-2 million NGOs."What is an NGO?"

Page 21. International NGOs were important in the anti-slavery movement and the movement for women''s suffrage, and reached a peak at the time of the World Disarmament Conference.{{cite book}} However, the phrase "non-governmental organization" only came into popular use with the establishment of the United Nations Organization in 1945 with provisions in Article 71 of Chapter 10 of the United Nations CharterCharter of the United Nations: Chapter X for a consultative role for organizations which are neither governments nor member states\u2014see Consultative Status. The definition of "international NGO" (INGO) is first given in resolution 288 (X) of ECOSOC on February 27, 1950: it is defined as "any international organization that is not founded by an international treaty". The vital role of NGOs and other "major groups" in sustainable development was recognized in Chapter 27Agenda 21 - Chapter 27: Strengthening the Role of Non-governmental Organizations: Partners for Sustainable Development, Earth Summit, 1992 of Agenda 21, leading to intense arrangements for a consultative relationship between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.1996/31. Consultative relationship between the United Nations and non-governmental organizationsRapid development of the non-governmental sector occurred in western countries as a result of the processes of restructurization of the welfare state. Further globalization of that process occurred after the fall of the communist system and was an important part of the Washington consensus Pawel Zaleski Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector, [in:] Gawin, Dariusz & Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006.Globalization during the 20th century gave rise to the importance of NGOs. Many problems could not be solved within a nation. International treaties and international organizations such as the World Trade Organization were perceived as being too centred on the interests of capitalist enterprises. Some argued that in an attempt to counterbalance this trend, NGOs have developed to emphasize humanitarian issues, developmental aid and sustainable development. A prominent example of this is the World Social Forum which is a rival convention to the World Economic Forum held annually in January in Davos, Switzerland. The fifth World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in January 2005 was attended by representatives from more than 1,000 NGOs.{{Citation needed}} Some have argued that in forums like these, NGOs take the place of what should belong to popular movements of the poor. Others argue that NGOs are often imperialistAbahlali baseMjondolo Rethinking Public Participation from below, ''Critical Dialogue'', 2006 in nature, that they sometimes operate in a racialized manner in dominant countries, and that they fulfil a similar function to that of the clergy during the high colonial era.

Non-governmental organizations are a heterogeneous group. A long list of acronyms has developed around the term "NGO".These include:\u000a\u000aBINGO, short for business-friendly international NGO or big international NGO;\u000aCITS, helping scientific community by motivating young talent towards research &#38; development\u000aCSO, short for civil society organization;\u000aDONGO: Donor Organized NGO;\u000aENGO: short for environmental NGO, such as Global 2000 ;\u000aGONGOs are government-operated NGOs, which may have been set up by governments to look like NGOs in order to qualify for outside aid or promote the interests of the government in question;\u000aINGO stands for international NGO; Oxfam is an international NGO and The Library Project out of Xian, China;\u000aQUANGOs are quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  (The ISO is actually not purely an NGO, since its membership is by nation, and each nation is represented by what the ISO Council determines to be the &#39;most broadly representative&#39; standardization body of a nation.  That body might itself be a nongovernmental organization; for example, the United States is represented in ISO by the American National Standards Institute, which is independent of the federal government.  However, other countries can be represented by national governmental agencies; this is the trend in Europe.)\u000aTANGO: short for technical assistance NGO;\u000aGSO: Grassroots Support Organization \u000aMANGO: short for market advocacy NGO\u000aCHARDS:Community Health and Rural Development Society\u000a\u000aThere are also numerous classifications of NGOs. The typology the World Bank uses divides them into Operational and Advocacy:World Bank Criteria defining NGOThe primary purpose of an operational NGO is the design and implementation of development-related projects.  One frequently used categorization is the division into relief-oriented versus development-oriented organizations; they can also be classified according to whether they stress service delivery or participation; or whether they are religious or secular; and whether they are more public or private-oriented. Operational NGOs can be community-based, national or international.The primary purpose of an Advocacy NGO is to defend or promote a specific cause. As opposed to operational project management, these organizations typically try to raise awareness, acceptance and knowledge by lobbying, press work and activist events.USAID refers to NGOs as private voluntary organisations. However many scholars have argued that this definition is highly problematic as many NGOs are in fact state and corporate funded and managed projects with professional staff.{{Citation needed}} NGOs exist for a variety of reasons, usually to further the political or social goals of their members or funders. Examples include improving the state of the natural environment, encouraging the observance of human rights, improving the welfare of the disadvantaged, or representing a corporate agenda. However, there are a huge number of such organizations and their goals cover a broad range of political and philosophical positions. This can also easily be applied to private schools and athletic organizations.\u000aMethodsNGOs vary in their methods.  Some act primarily as lobbyists, while others primarily conduct programs and activities. For instance, an NGO such as Oxfam, concerned with poverty alleviation, might provide needy people with the equipment and skills to find food and clean drinking water, whereas an NGO like the FFDA helps through investigation and documentation of human rights violations and provides legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. Others, such as Afghanistan Information Management Services, provide specialized technical products and services to support development activities implemented on the ground by other organizations.\u000aPublic relationsNon-governmental organizations need healthy relationships with the public to meet their goals. Foundations and charities use sophisticated public relations campaigns to raise funds and employ standard lobbying techniques with governments. Interest groups may be of political importance because of their ability to influence social and political outcomes. A code of ethics Wango.org was established in 2002 by The World Association of Non Governmental NGOs.\u000aConsulting\u000aProject managementThere is an increasing awareness that management techniques are crucial to project success in non-governmental organizations.LSE.ac.uk, Mukasa, Sarah. Are expatriate staff necessary in international development NGOs? A case study of an international NGO in Uganda. Publication of the Centre for Civil Society at London School of Economics. 2002, p. 11\u201313. Generally, non-governmental organizations that are private have either a community or environmental focus. They address varieties of issues such as religion, emergency aid, or humanitarian affairs. They mobilize public support and voluntary contributions for aid; they often have strong links with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government-to-government aid is not possible. NGOs are accepted as a part of the international relations landscape, and while they influence national and multilateral policy-making, increasingly they are more directly involved in local action.\u000aStaffingNot all people working for non-governmental organizations are volunteers. The reasons people volunteer are not necessarily purely altruistic, and can provide immediate benefits for themselves as well as those they serve, including skills, experience, and contacts. There is some dispute as to whether expatriates should be sent to developing countries. Frequently this type of personnel is employed to satisfy a donor who wants to see the supported project managed by someone from an industrialized country. However, the expertise these employees or volunteers may be counterbalanced by a number of factors: the cost of foreigners is typically higher, they have no grassroot connections in the country they are sent to, and local expertise is often undervalued.The NGO sector is an important employer in terms of numbers.{{Citation needed}} For example, by the end of 1995, CONCERN worldwide, an international Northern NGO working against poverty, employed 174 expatriates and just over 5,000 national staff working in ten developing countries in Africa and Asia, and in Haiti.\u000aFundingLarge NGOs may have annual budgets in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. For instance, the budget of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) was over US$540 million in 1999.{{cite web}} Funding such large budgets demands significant fundraising efforts on the part of most NGOs. Major sources of NGO funding include membership dues, the sale of goods and services, grants from international institutions or national governments, and private donations. Several EU-grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.Even though the term "non-governmental organization" implies independence from governments, most NGOs depend heavily on governments for their funding. A quarter of the US$162 million income in 1998 of the famine-relief organization Oxfam was donated by the British government and the EU. The Christian relief and development organization World Vision collected US$55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. Nobel Prize winner M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) (known in the USA as Doctors Without Borders) gets 46% of its income from government sources.Intractable Conflict Knowledge Base Project of the Conflict Research Consortium at the University of Colorado.Government funding of NGOs is controversial, since, according to David Rieff, writing in The New Republic, "the whole point of humanitarian intervention was precisely that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter."NG-Uh-O - The trouble with humanitarianism David Rieff, June 10, 2010, The New Republic\u000aMonitoring and controlIn a March 2000 report on United Nations Reform priorities, former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan wrote in favor of international humanitarian intervention, arguing that the international community has a "right to protect" citizens of the world against ethnic cleansing, genocide, and crimes against humanity. On the heels of the report, the Canadian government launched the Responsibility to Protect {{PDFlink}} project, outlining the issue of humanitarian intervention. While the R2P doctrine has wide applications, among the more controversial has been the Canadian government''s use of R2P to justify its intervention and support of the coup in Haiti.{{Citation needed}}Years after R2P, the World Federalist Movement, an organization which supports "the creation of democratic global structures accountable to the citizens of the world and call for the division of international authority among separate agencies", has launched Responsibility to Protect - Engaging Civil Society (R2PCS). A collaboration between the WFM and the Canadian government, this project aims to bring NGOs into lockstep with the principles outlined under the original R2P project. The governments of the countries an NGO works or is registered in may require reporting or  other monitoring and oversight.  Funders generally require reporting and assessment, such information is not necessarily publicly available. There may also be associations and watchdog organizations that research and publish details on the actions of NGOs working in particular geographic or program areas.{{Citation needed}}In recent years, many large corporations have increased their corporate social responsibility departments in an attempt to preempt NGO campaigns against certain corporate practices. As the logic goes, if corporations work with NGOs, NGOs will not work against corporations.In December 2007, The United States Department of Defense Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) S. Ward Casscells established an International Health Division under Force Health Protection & Readiness.OSD.mil Part of International Health''s mission is to communicate with NGOs in areas of mutual interest. Department of Defense Directive 3000.05,DTIC.mil in 2005, requires DoD to regard stability-enhancing activities as a mission of importance equal to warfighting. In compliance with international law, DoD has necessarily built a capacity to improve essential services in areas of conflict such as Iraq, where the customary lead agencies (State Department and USAID) find it difficult to operate. Unlike the "co-option" strategy described for corporations, the OASD(HA) recognizes the  neutrality of health as an essential service. International Health cultivates collaborative relationships with NGOs, albeit at arms-length, recognizing their traditional independence, expertise and honest broker status. While the goals of DoD and NGOs may seem incongruent, the DoD''s emphasis on stability and security to reduce and prevent conflict suggests, on careful analysis, important mutual interests.\u000aLegal statusThe legal form of NGOs is diverse and depends upon homegrown variations in each country''s laws and practices. However, four main family groups of NGOs can be found worldwide:Grant B. Stillman (2007), Global Standard NGOs, Geneva: Lulu, pp. 13-14.\u000a\u000aUnincorporated and voluntary association\u000aTrusts, charities and foundations\u000aCompanies not just for profit\u000aEntities formed or registered under special NGO or nonprofit laws\u000a\u000aNGOs are not subjects of  international law, as states are. An exception is the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is subject to certain specific matters, mainly relating to the Geneva Convention.The Council of Europe in Strasbourg drafted the European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organizations in 1986, which sets a common legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe. Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs.\u000aCitizen organizationThere is a growing movement within the \u201cnon-profit organization" and \u201cnon\u201d-government sector to define itself in a more constructive, accurate way.  Instead of being defined by \u201cnon\u201d words, organizations are suggesting new terminology to describe the sector.  The term \u201ccivil society organization\u201d (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations, such as the Center for the Study of Global Governance.Glasius, Marlies, Mary Kaldor and Helmut Anheier (eds.) "Global Civil Society 2006/7". London: Sage, 2005. The term \u201ccitizen sector organization\u201d (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector \u2014 as one of citizens, for citizens.Drayton, W: "Words Matter". Alliance Magazine, Vol. 12/No.2, June 2007. This labels and positions the sector as its own entity, without relying on language used for the government or business sectors. However some have argued that this is not particularly helpful given that most NGOs are in fact funded by governments and business and that some NGOs are clearly hostile to independently organized people''s organizations.South African Grassroots Movements Rebel Against NGO Authoritarianism\u000aSTEPS IN ESTABLISHING NGOsThe first step in the establishment of the NGO is to identify the area of peculiar needs of the society, such as health, HIV/AIDS, Maternal Mortality, Polio, food,  shelter, civil liberty and poverty alleviation among others.\u000aThe second step is to identify people of similar minds; there must be a unity of purpose.\u000aThe third step is to engage the services of a qualified legal practitioner for guidance for the Registration process. Some NGOs can be reigstered with the regional or central government and that depends on the scope of the operations of the proposed NGO. The next important step also is to identify the internal or external partners with a clearly stated objectives and plan of actions.\u000aSee also\u000a\u000a\u000aNotes and references{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading\u000a\u000aMark Butler, with Thulani Ndlazi, David Ntseng, Graham Philpott, and Nomusa Sokhela.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(35,0,'South Asia\u000a\u000a\u000aSouth Asia, also known as Southern Asia, is the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan countries and, for some authorities (see below), also includes the adjoining countries on the west and the east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as the Indian subcontinent south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is surrounded (clockwise, from west) by Western Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia and the Indian ocean.South Asia typically consists of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Some definitions may also include Afghanistan, Burma, Tibet, and the British Indian Ocean Territories.According to CIA World Fact Book, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, British Indian ocean territory, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka comprise South Asia. Iran is also included in the UN subregion of "Southern Asia," although many sources consider Iran as being part of West Asia.http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007003-eng.htm#1http://www.westasiangames.com/http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/seasia.pdfhttp://books.google.com/books?id=n9NZOYtOnyIC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=west+asian+iran&source=bl&ots=XsVoAjyvjC&sig=WehilL-0iyxTOFPyyINTpSEqJyA&hl=en&ei=AAQWS978ENGUnQfhsczTBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CCAQ6AEwCTgy#v=onepage&q=west%20asian%20iran&f=falsehttp://www.fao.org/docrep/V7245E/V7245E0l.htmCIA World Fact Book Various universities'' departments of South Asian Studies also, by and large, reject the idea that Iran is part of South Asia  (see below).South Asia is home to well over one fifth of the world''s population, making it both the most populous and most densely populated geographical region in the world.http://www.sardeg.org/marketana.asp  The region has often seen conflicts and political instability, including wars between the region''s two nuclear-armed states, Pakistan and India.

South Asia''s north, east, and west boundaries vary based on definitions used. South Asia''s southern border is the Indian Ocean. The UN subregion of Southern Asia''s northern boundary would be the Himalayas, its western boundary would be made up of the Iraq-Iran border, Turkey-Iran border, Armenia-Iran border, and the Azerbaijan-Iran border. Its eastern boundary would be the India-Burma border and the Bangladesh-Burma border.Most of this region is a subcontinent resting on the Indian Plate (the northerly portion of the Indo-Australian Plate) separated from the rest of Eurasia. It was once a small continent before colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50-55 million years ago and giving birth to the Himalayan range and the Tibetan plateau. It is the peninsular region south of the Himalayas and Kuen Lun mountain ranges and east of the Indus River and the Iranian Plateau, extending southward into the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Sea (to the southwest) and the Bay of Bengal (to the southeast).\u000aThe region is home to an astounding variety of geographical features, such as glaciers, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and grasslands that are typical of much larger continents. It is surrounded by three water bodies \u2014 the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. The climate of this vast region varies considerably from area to area from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude, but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons.Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon period(s). The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalyan ranges. As the Himalayas block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For most part, the climate of the region is called the Monsoon climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favors the cultivation of jute, tea, rice, and various vegetables in this region.\u000aHistory{{See}}\u000a\u000aThe remote pre-history of South Asia culminates in the Indus Valley Civilization, which is followed by the legends of ancient Vedic period and the sketchy references to the rise and fall of Mahajanapadas - the precursors of regional kingdoms and later ancient empires - ending in the historical accounts of medieval empires and the arrival of European traders who later became the rulers.Almost all South Asian countries were under direct or indirect European Colonial subjugation at some point. Much of modern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar were gradually occupied by Great Britain - starting from 1757, reaching their zenith in 1857 and ruling till 1947. Nepal and Bhutan were to some extent protectorates of Great Britain until after World War II. In the millennia long history of South Asia, this European occupation period is rather short, but its proximity to the present and its lasting impact on the region make it prominent.The network of means of transportation and communication as well as banking and training of requisite workforce, and also the existing rail, post, telegraph, and education facilities have evolved out of the base established in the colonial era, often called the British Raj. As an aftermath of World War II, most of the region gained independence from Europe by the late 1940s.Tibet at times has governed itself as an independent state and at other times has had various levels of association with ChinaMSN Encarta - TibetEncyclopedia Britannica - "China, Asia", 1911, read in part: "CHINA, a country of eastern Asia, the principal division of the Chinese empire. In addition to China proper the Chinese Empire includes Manchuria, Mongolia, Tibet and Sin-kiang (East Turkestan, Kulja, Dzungaria, &c., i.e. all the Chinese dependencies lying between.

The ambans were given rights of control and supervision and since 1792 also a direct participation in the Tibetan government." in spite of British efforts to seize possession of this Chinese protectorate at the beginning of the 20th century.Gernet, J., Foster, J.R. & Hartman C., A History of Chinese Civilization, Cambridge University Press, 1982, p481, reads in part: "From 1751 onwards Chinese control over Tibet became permanent and remained so more or less ever after, in spite of British efforts to seize possession of this Chinese protectorate at the beginning of the twentieth century."  Tibetan and Chinese views on the Sino-Tibetan relation vary significantly. The Tibetans saw the Dalai Lama''s relation with the Manchu emperor in more of a religious light than what would be considered political.Since 1947, most South Asian countries have achieved tremendous progress in all spheres.{{Citation needed}} Most notable achievements are in the fields of education; industry; health care; information technology and other services based on its applications; research in the fields of cutting edge sciences and technologies; defence related self-reliance projects; international/global trade and business enterprises and outsourcing of human resources.

South Asia has been invaded and settled by many ethnic groups over the centuries - including various Dravidian, Indo-Aryan and Iranian groups - and amalgamation of Dravidian, Indo-Aryan and native societies has produced composite cultures with many common traditions and beliefs. But, the traditions of different ethnic groups in South Asia have diverged throughout earlier times, sometimes giving rise to strong local traditions such as the distinct South Indian culture.Other ethnic groups, successively streaming in later mainly from Central Asia and Iran, e.g. Sakas, Kushans, Huns etc. influenced pre-existing South Asian cultures. Among the last of these new arrivals were the Arabs followed by the Turks, the Pashtuns and the Moghuls. However, Arab influence remained relatively limited in comparison to that of the Turks, Pashtuns and Moghuls, who brought in much cultural influence and contributed to the birth of Urdu, a syncretic language of combined Indo-Persian heritage, which is widely spoken today. Ethnic Englishmen and other Britons are now practically absent after their two centuries long colonial presence, although they have left an imprint of western culture in the elite society.\u000aLanguages{{See also}}\u000aThe largest spoken language in this region is now Hindi, its speakers numbering almost 422 millionhttp://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm; the second largest spoken language is Bengali, with about 210 million speakers {{cite web}}.\u000aUrdu is also a major language spoken in the subcontinent, especially in Pakistan and India, and is similar linguistically to Hindi; Hindi and Urdu together make up Hindust\u0101n\u012b. Hindi is spoken is some states of India, and is similar linguistically to Urdu. Many people are not aware of the fact that most of the Indians speak local languages and are not familiar with Hindi. Other languages of this region fall into a few major linguistic groups: the Dravidian languages and the Indo-Aryan languages, a sub-branch of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages.The other great sub-branch of Indo-Iranian, the Iranian languages, also have significant minority representation in South Asia, with Pashtu and Baluchi being widely spoken along the northwestern fringes of the region, in modern-day Pakistan. Many Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups, who are speakers of their language-group, are found in northeast India, Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. Other small groups, speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, are also present in South Asia. English is another language which dominates South Asia, especially as a medium of advanced education and government administration.Most of South Asia writes using various abugidas of Br\u0101hm\u012b origin while languages such as Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi use derivatives of the Perso-Arabic script. Not all languages in South Asia follow this strict dichotomy though. For example, Kashmiri is written in both the Perso-Arabic script and in the Devanagari script. The same can be said for Punjabi, which is written in both Shahmukhi and Gurmukh\u012b. Dhivehi is written in a script called T\u0101na that shows characteristics of both the Arabic alphabet and of an abugida.\u000aReligions{{See}}In South Asia Hinduism and Islam and in some of its countries Buddhism are the dominant religions. Other Indian religions and Christianity are practiced by significant number of people.Historically, fusion of Indo-Aryan Vedic religion with native South Asian non-Vedic Shramana traditions and other Dravidian and local tribal beliefs gave rise to the ancient religions of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism and much later to Sikhism, when Sufi tradition of Islam also significantly influenced the nascent Sikhism and its holiest scripture. As a consequence, these four religions share many similar cultural practices, festivals and traditions.Arabs brought  the Abrahamic religion of Islam to South Asia, first in the present day Kerala and the Maldive Islands and later in Sindh, Balochistan and much of Punjab. Subsequently, Muslim Turks/Pashtuns/Moghuls furthered it not only among the Punjabi and Kashmiri people but also throughout the Indo-Gangetic plains and farther east, and deep south up to the Deccan.\u000a\u000aAfghanistanCIA - The World Factbook - Afghanistan Sunni Muslim (80%), Shi&#39;a Muslim (19%), other (1%) \u000aBangladeshBangladesh : AT A GLANCE Muslim (90%), Hindu (9%), Christian (.5%), Buddhist (.5%), Believers in tribal faiths (0.1%) \u000aBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryThe Association of Religion Data Archives | National Profiles Christian (45.55%), Hindu (38.55%), Muslim (9.25%), Non-Religious (6.50%), Atheist (0.10%), Other (0.05%) \u000aBhutanCIA - The World Factbook Buddhist (75%), Hindu (25%) \u000aBurmaCIA - The World Factbook - Burma Theravada Buddhism (89%), Muslim (4%), Christian (4%) (Baptist 3%, Roman Catholic 1%), Animist (1%), others (including Hinduism) (2%) \u000aIndiaCIA - The World FactbookIndian Census Hindu (80.5%), Muslim (13.4%), Christian (2.3%), Sikh (1.9%), Buddhist (0.8%), Jain (0.4%), Others (0.6%) \u000aIranCIA - The World Factbook Shi&#39;a Muslim (89%), Sunni Muslim (9%), Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, and Baha&#39;i (2%) \u000aMaldivesMaldives - maldives religion Sunni Muslim (100%) (One must be a Sunni Muslim to be a citizen on the MaldivesMaldivesMaldives - Religion, countrystudies.us) \u000aNepalNEPAL Hindu (80.6%), Buddhist (10.7%), Muslim (4.2%), Kirat (3.6%) \u000aPakistanPopulation by religions, Statistics Division of the Government of Pakistan Muslim (96.28%), Hindu (1.85%), Christian (1.59%), Ahmadi (0.22%) \u000aSri Lankahttp://web.archive.org/web/20070513050552/http://www.statistics.gov.lk/census2001/population/ds_div/t001b.htm Theravada Buddhist (70.42%), Hindu (10.89%), Muslim (8.78%), Catholic (7.77%), Other Christian (1.96%), Other (0.13%) \u000aTibet Tibetan Buddhism, B\u00f6n, Others \u000a\u000aEconomy{{See}}South Asia is the poorest region on the earth as well as Sub-Saharan Africa, and it has the lowest GDP per capita.

The report mentioned that, although there has been a reduction in malnutrition due to the Green Revolution in South Asia, there is concern that South Asia has "inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children".{{cite web}}.\u000aSee also{{Portal box}}\u000a\u000aGreater India\u000aIndology\u000aSouth Asian cuisine\u000aIndian subcontinent\u000a{{Clear}}\u000aNotes and references{{Reflist}}\u000aExternal links\u000a\u000aWorld Bank, South Asia Region\u000aBBC News South Asia\u000aBirding in South Asia\u000aSouth Asian Awareness Network Conference Website\u000aDigital South Asia Library\u000a{{Regions of the world}}\u000a{{GeoSouthAsia}}\u000a{{Countries of South Asia}}\u000a{{Languages of South Asia}}\u000a\u000aace:Asia Seulatan\u000aar:\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0622\u0633\u064a\u0627\u000abn:\u09a6\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09bf\u09a3 \u098f\u09b6\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u000azh-min-nan:L\u00e2m-a\u000abe-x-old:\u041f\u0430\u045e\u0434\u043d\u0451\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0456\u044f\u000abs:Ju\u017ena Azija\u000aca:\u00c0sia Meridional\u000acv:\u041a\u0103\u043d\u0442\u0103\u0440 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u000acs:Ji\u017en\u00ed Asie\u000ada:Sydasien\u000ade:S\u00fcdasien\u000adv:\u078b\u07ac\u0786\u07aa\u0782\u07aa \u0787\u07ad\u079d\u07a8\u0794\u07a7\u000anv:Naakaii Doot\u0142izh\u00ed Dabik\u00e9yah\u000aet:L\u00f5una-Aasia\u000aes:Asia del Sur\u000aeo:Suda Azio\u000aeu:Hegoaldeko Asia\u000afa:\u0622\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u000ahif:South Asia\u000afy:S\u00fad-Aazje\u000agl:Asia Meridional\u000agu:\u0aa6\u0a95\u0acd\u0ab7\u0abf\u0aa3 \u0a8f\u0ab6\u0abf\u0aaf\u0abe\u000ako:\ub0a8\uc544\uc2dc\uc544\u000ahy:\u0540\u0561\u0580\u0561\u057e\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0531\u057d\u056b\u0561\u000ahi:\u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u090f\u0936\u093f\u092f\u093e\u000ahr:Ju\u017ena Azija\u000aid:Asia Selatan\u000ais:Su\u00f0ur-As\u00eda\u000ait:Asia meridionale\u000akw:Asi Soth\u000asw:Asia ya Kusini\u000alv:Dienvid\u0101zija\u000alt:Piet\u0173 Azija\u000ahu:D\u00e9l-\u00c1zsia\u000amk:\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430\u000amr:\u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923 \u0906\u0936\u093f\u092f\u093e\u000ams:Asia Selatan\u000anl:Zuid-Azi\u00eb\u000aja:\u5357\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u000ano:S\u00f8r-Asia\u000ann:S\u00f8r-Asia\u000apl:Azja Po\u0142udniowa\u000apt:\u00c1sia Meridional\u000army:Sudutni Asiya\u000aru:\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f\u000asah:\u0421\u043e\u0495\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0443 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f\u000asq:Azia Jugore\u000asimple:South Asia\u000ask:Ju\u017en\u00e1 \u00c1zia\u000asl:Ju\u017ena Azija\u000asr:\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430\u000asu:Asia Kidul\u000afi:Etel\u00e4-Aasia\u000asv:Sydasien\u000atl:Timog Asya\u000ata:\u0ba4\u0bc6\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b86\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u000att:\u041a\u04e9\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f\u000ath:\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e43\u0e15\u0e49\u000atr:G\u00fcney Asya\u000auk:\u041f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0437\u0456\u044f\u000aur:\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0621\u000avi:Nam \u00c1\u000awar:Salatan nga Asya\u000ayo:South Asia\u000azh-yue:\u5357\u4e9e\u000azh:\u5357\u4e9a','South Asia','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia')

It is separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. According to Hindu mythology, a land bridge to the Indian mainland, known as Rama''s Bridge, was constructed during the time of Rama by the vanara architect Nala. Often referred to as Adam''s Bridge, it now amounts to only a chain of limestone shoals remaining above sea level.BBC News, Gods row minister offers to quit, September 15, 2007. According to colonial British reports, this is a natural causeway which was formerly complete, but was breached by a violent storm in 1480.Rediff, Ramar Sethu, a world heritage centre?, July 4, 2007. The island consists mostly of flat-to-rolling coastal plains, with mountains rising only in the south-central part. Amongst these is the highest point Pidurutalagala, reaching {{convert}} above sea level.The climate of Sri Lanka can be described as tropical and warm. Its position between 5 and 10 north latitude endows the country with a warm climate moderated by ocean winds and considerable moisture. The mean temperature ranges from about {{convert}} in the Central Highlands, where frost may occur for several days in the winter, to a maximum of approximately {{convert}} in other low-altitude areas. The average yearly temperature ranges from {{convert}} to nearly {{convert}}. Day and night temperatures may vary by {{convert}}  to {{convert}}. During the coldest days of January, many people wear coats and sweaters in the highlands and elsewhere. May, the hottest period, precedes the summer monsoon rains. The rainfall pattern is influenced by monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal: as the winds encounter the mountain slopes of the Central Highlands, they unload heavy rains on the slopes and the southwestern areas of the island. Some of the windward slopes receive up to {{convert}} of rain each month, but the leeward slopes in the east and northeast receive little rain. Periodic squalls occur and sometimes tropical cyclones bring overcast skies and rains to the southwest, northeast, and eastern parts of the island. Between December and March, monsoon winds come from the northeast, bringing moisture from the Bay of Bengal. Humidity is typically higher in the southwest and mountainous areas and depends on the seasonal patterns of rainfall, and places like Colombo experience daytime humidity above 70% all year round, rising to almost 90% during the monsoon season in June. Anuradhapura experiences a daytime low of 60% during the monsoon month of March, but a high of 79% during the November and December rains. In the highlands, Kandy''s daytime humidity usually ranges between 70% and 79%.\u000aFlora and fauna{{Main}}\u000aThe mountains and the southwestern part of the country, known as the "wet zone", receive ample rainfall at an average of {{convert}}. Most of the east, southeast, and northern parts of the country comprise the "dry zone", which receives between {{convert}} and {{convert}} of rain annually. Much of the rain in these areas falls from October to January; during the rest of the year there is very little precipitation. The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain at {{convert}} to {{convert}} per year. Varieties of flowering acacias are well adapted to the arid conditions and flourish on the Jaffna Peninsula. Among the trees of the dry-land forests, are some valuable species such as satinwood, ebony, ironwood, mahogany and teak. In the wet zone, the dominant vegetation of the lowlands is a tropical evergreen forest, with tall trees, broad foliage, and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. Subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in the higher altitudes. Forests at one time covered nearly the entire island, but by the late 20th century lands classified as forests and forest reserves covered around \u2153 of the land.EarthTrends, Environmental Information, Forests, Grasslands, and Drylands-- Sri Lanka. The Yala National Park in the southeast protects herds of elephant, deer, and peacocks, and the Wilpattu National Park in the northwest preserves the habitats of many water birds, such as storks, pelicans, ibis, and spoonbills. During the Mahaweli Ganga Program of the 1970s and 1980s in northern Sri Lanka, the government set aside four areas of land totaling {{convert}} as national parks. The island has four biosphere reserves, Bundala, Hurulu Forest Reserve, the Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya, and Sinharaja.{{cite web}}The national flower of Sri Lanka is the Nymphaea stellata (Sinhalese Nil Mahanel),{{cite web}} the national tree is the Ironwood (Sinhalese Na),{{cite web}} and the national bird is the Sri Lanka Junglefowl, which is endemic to the country.{{cite web}}\u000a{{Clear}}\u000aHistory{{Main}}\u000aEarly periods\u000aPaleolithic human settlements have been discovered at excavations in several cave sites in the Western Plains region and the South-western face of the Central Hills region. Anthropologists believe that some discovered burial rites and certain decorative artifacts exhibit similarities between the first inhabitants of the island and the early inhabitants of Southern India. Recent bioanthropological studies have however dismissed these links, and have placed the origin of the people to the northern parts of India{{Citation needed}}. One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian epic Ramayana, which described the emperor Ravana as monarch of the powerful kingdom of Lanka, which was created by the divine sculptor Vishwakarma for Kubera, the treasurer of the Gods.{{cite book}} English historian James Emerson Tennent also theorized Galle, a southern city in Sri Lanka, was the ancient seaport of Tarshish from which King Solomon is said to have drawn ivory, peacocks and other valuables. The main written accounts of the country''s history are the Buddhist chronicles of Mahavansa and Dipavamsa.\u000a\u000aThe earliest-known inhabitants of the island now known as Sri Lanka were probably the ancestors of the Wanniyala-Aetto people, also known as Veddahs and numbering roughly 3,000. Linguistic analysis has found a correlation of the Sinhalese language with the languages of the Sindh and Gujarat, although most historians believe that the Sinhala community emerged well after the assimilation of various ethnic groups. From the ancient period date some remarkable archaeological sites including the ruins of Sigiriya, the so-called "Fortress in the Sky", and huge public works. Among the latter are large "tanks" or reservoirs, important for conserving water in a climate that alternates rainy seasons with dry times, and elaborate aqueducts, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile. Ancient Sri Lanka was also the first in the world to have established a dedicated hospital in Mihintale in the 4th century BCE. Ancient Sri Lanka was also the world''s leading exporter of cinnamon, which was exported to Egypt as early as 1400 BCE. Sri Lanka was also the first Asian nation to have a female ruler in Queen Anula (47\u201342 BC).\u000aAncient Sri LankaSince ancient times Sri Lanka was ruled by monarchs, most notably of the Sinha royal dynasty that lasted over 2000 years. The island was also infrequently invaded by South Indian kingdoms and parts of the island were ruled intermittently by the Chola dynasty, the Pandya dynasty, the Chera dynasty and the Pallava dynasty. The island was also invaded by the kingdoms of Kalinga (modern Orissa) and those from the Malay Peninsula. Buddhism arrived from India in the 3rd century BCE, brought by Bhikkhu Mahinda, who is believed to have been the son of Mauryan emperor Ashoka. Mahinda''s mission won over the Sinhalese monarch Devanampiyatissa of Mihintale, who embraced the faith and propagated it throughout the Sinhalese population. The Buddhist kingdoms of Sri Lanka would maintain a large number of Buddhist schools and monasteries, and support the propagation of Buddhism into Southeast Asia.\u000aColonial era\u000aSri Lanka had always been an important port and trading post in the ancient world, and was increasingly frequented by merchant ships from the Middle East, Persia, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The islands were known to the first European explorers of South Asia and settled by many groups of Arab and Malay merchants. A Portuguese colonial mission arrived on the island in 1505 headed by Louren\u00e7o de Almeida, the son of Francisco de Almeida. At that point the island consisted of three kingdoms, namely Kandy in the central hills, Kotte at the Western coast, and Yarlpanam (Anglicised Jaffna) in the north. The Dutch arrived in the 17th century. Although much of the island came under the domain of European powers, the interior, hilly region of the island remained independent, with its capital in Kandy. The British East India Company established control of the island in 1796, declaring it a crown colony in 1802, although the island would not be officially connected with British India. The fall of the kingdom of Kandy in 1815 unified the island under British rule.\u000a20th Century and the World WarsEuropean colonists established a series of tea, cinnamon, rubber, sugar, coffee and indigo plantations. The British also brought a large number of indentured workers from Tamil Nadu to work in the plantation economy. The city of Colombo was established as the administrative centre, and the British established modern schools, colleges, roads and churches that brought Western-style education and culture to the native people. Increasing grievances over the denial of civil rights, mistreatment and abuse of natives by colonial authorities gave rise to a struggle for independence in the 1930s, when the Youth Leagues opposed the "Ministers'' Memorandum," which asked the colonial authority to increase the powers of the board of ministers without granting popular representation or civil freedoms. Buddhist scholars{{Citation needed}} and the Teetotalist Movement also played a vital role in this time. During World War II, the island served as an important Allied military base. A large segment of the British and American fleet were deployed on the island, as were tens of thousands of soldiers committed to the war against Japan in Southeast Asia.  It was expected that Sri Lanka would gain independence as part of India, as the Indian National Army created a ''Lanka Regiment'' from the existent Sri Lankan diaspora.  Indeed, A plan was made to transport them to Sri Lanka by submarine, to lead a liberation struggle there, but this was aborted.\u000aIndependence{{Anchor}}{{Main}}\u000a\u000aFollowing the war, popular pressure for independence intensified. The office of Prime Minister of Ceylon was created in advance of independence on 14 October 1947, Don Stephen Senanayake being the first prime minister. On February 4, 1948 the country won its independence as the Dominion of Ceylon. The island enjoyed good relations with the United Kingdom and had the British Royal Navy stationed at Trincomalee.On July 21, 1960 Sirimavo Bandaranaike took office as prime minister, and became the world''s first female prime minister and the first female head of government in post-colonial Asia. In 1972, during Sirimavo Bandaranaike''s second term as prime minister, the country became a republic within the Commonwealth, and the name was changed to Sri Lanka.\u000aCivil war{{Main}}One of the aspects of the independence movement was that it was very much a Sinhalese movement. As a result, the Sinhalese majority attempted to remodel Sri Lanka as a Sinhalese nation-state. The lion in the national flag is derived from the banner of the last Sinhalese Kingdom, which, to the Sinhalese majority, is a symbol of their fight against British colonialism. One single strip of orange on the left part of the flag represents the Tamil population, and it is seen by many Tamil as a symbol of their marginalisation.{{cite web}}In 1956, the Official Language Act (commonly known as The Sinhala Only Act) was enacted. The law mandated Sinhala, the language of Sri Lanka''s majority Sinhalese community, which is spoken by over 70% of Sri Lanka''s population, as the sole official language of Sri Lanka. Supporters of the law saw it as an attempt by a community that had just gained independence to distance themselves from their colonial masters. The immediate (and intended) consequence of this act was to force large numbers of Tamil who worked in the civil service, and who could not meet this language requirement, to resign. An attempt to make Buddhism the national religion, to the exclusion of Hindu and Islam, was also made. Affirmative action in favour of Sinhalese was also instituted, ostensibly to reverse colonial discrimination against Sinhalese in favour of Tamil.  Many Tamil, in response to this deliberate marginalisation, came to believe that they deserved a separate nation-state for themselves.From 1983 to 2009, there was an on-and-off civil war against the government by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization who fought to create an independent state named Tamil Eelam in the North and East of the island. Both the Sri Lankan government and LTTE have been accused of various human rights violations.On May 19, 2009, the President of Sri Lanka officially claimed an end to the insurgency and the defeat of the LTTE, following the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran and much of the LTTE''s other senior leadership.{{cite web}}\u000aPost War\u000aAfter the civil war was over, the government of Sri Lanka called for redevelopment of the nation. The final stages of the war left some 300,000 people displaced.{{cite web}} By 2 May 2010, 214,227 IDPs (74%) had been released or returned to their places of origin.{{cite web}}\u000aGovernment and politics{{Main}}\u000a{{See also}}\u000aThe Constitution of Sri Lanka establishes a democratic, socialist republic in Sri Lanka, which is also a unitary state. The government is a mixture of the presidential system and the parliamentary system. The President of Sri Lanka is the head of state, the commander in chief of the armed forces, as well as head of government, and is popularly elected for a six-year term. In the exercise of duties, the President is responsible to the Parliament of Sri Lanka, which is a unicameral 225-member legislature. The President appoints and heads a cabinet of ministers composed of elected members of parliament. The President''s deputy is the Prime Minister, who leads the ruling party in parliament and shares many executive responsibilities, mainly in domestic affairs.The Constitution of Sri Lanka - Contents. Members of parliament are elected by universal (adult) suffrage based on a modified proportional representation system by district to a six-year term. The primary modification is that, the party that receives the largest number of valid votes in each constituency gains a unique "bonus seat." The president may summon, suspend, or end a legislative session and dissolve Parliament any time after it has served for one year. The parliament reserves the power to make all laws. On July 1, 1960 the people of Sri Lanka elected the first-ever female head of government in Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Her daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga served for a short period as the prime minister between August and December 1994 before being elected as president from 1994 to 2005 for 2 consecutive terms. The current president and prime minister, both of whom took office on November 21, 2005, are Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ratnasiri Wickremanayake respectively.Sri Lanka has enjoyed democracy with universal suffrage since 1931. Politics in Sri Lanka are controlled by rival coalitions led by the left-wing Sri Lanka Freedom Party, headed by President Rajapaksa, the comparatively right-wing United National Party led by former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and JVP. There are also many smaller Buddhist, socialist and Tamil nationalist political parties that oppose the separatism of the LTTE but demand regional autonomy and increased civil rights. Since 1948, Sri Lanka has been a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. It is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Colombo Plan, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Through the Cold War-era, Sri Lanka followed a foreign policy of non-alignment but has remained closer to the United States and Western Europe. The military of Sri Lanka comprises the Sri Lankan Army, the Sri Lankan Navy and the Sri Lankan Air Force. These are administered by the Ministry of Defence. During 1971 and 1989 the army assisted the police in government response against the Marxist militants of the JVP and fought the LTTE from 1983 to 2009. Sri Lanka receives considerable military assistance from Pakistan and China.{{cite news}}\u000aForeign relations and military\u000aForeign relations{{Main}}\u000a{{See also}}Sri Lanka traditionally follows a nonaligned foreign policy but has been seeking closer relations with the United States since December 1977. It participates in multilateral diplomacy, particularly at the United Nations, where it seeks to promote sovereignty, independence, and development in the developing world. Sri Lanka was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). It also is a member of the Commonwealth, the SAARC, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank, and the Colombo Plan. Sri Lanka continues its active participation in the NAM, while also stressing the importance it places on regionalism by playing a strong role in SAARC.\u000aMilitary{{Main}}The Sri Lanka Armed Forces, comprising the Sri Lanka Army, the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Air Force, comes under the purview of the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The total strength of the three services is around 230,000 active personnel. Sri Lanka does not use a military draft. The Sri Lanka Armed Forces carried out a successful military campaign against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam which was proscribed as a terrorist organization by 32 countries and defeated the outfit comprehensively in May 2009, marking a rare occurrence in world military history.{{cite news}} In support of the armed forces there are two paramilitary units functioning under purview of the Ministry of Defence, which are the Special Task Force and the Civil Defence Force. Sri Lanka did not have a Coast Guard service until Aug 10, 2009 and its Navy carried out such duties. Discussions were underway with respect to establishing a coast guard service.{{cite web}} and on Aug 10, 2009 director-general of Sri Lanka Department of Coast Guard Daya Dharmapriya officially announced the on behalf of the government the launching of the service.{{cite web}}Since independence from Britain in 1948, the primary focus of the armed forces has been on internal security, due to three major insurgencies, most notably engaged in the 30-year long war with the LTTE and finally claimed victory at 19 May 2009 after the death of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran which took place at 18 May 2009 by a Sri Lanka army attack.\u000aPeace keepingEven though its armed forces were then engaged in an internal conflict, Sri Lanka contributed with forces in international missions organised by the United Nations, notably the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and continue to contribute their forces to the United Nations. On the 21 October 2009 another group of two hundred Sri Lankan troops including nine officers from all three branches of the armed forces were added to the current deployment in a passing-out parade. The two hundred troops are scheduled to leave for Haiti on 8 November 2009.{{cite web}}\u000a{{Clear}}\u000aEconomy{{Main}}\u000a{{See also}}\u000aIn the 19th and 20th Centuries, Sri Lanka became a plantation economy, famous for its production and export of cinnamon, rubber and Ceylon tea, which remains a trademark national export. The development of modern ports under British rule raised the strategic importance of the island as a centre of trade. During World War II, the island hosted important military installations and Allied forces. However, the plantation economy aggravated poverty and economic inequality. From 1948 to 1977 socialism strongly influenced the government''s economic policies. Colonial plantations were dismantled, industries were nationalised and a welfare state established. While the standard of living and literacy improved significantly, the nation''s economy suffered from inefficiency, slow growth and lack of foreign investment{{Citation needed}}. From 1977 the UNP government began incorporating privatisation, deregulation and the promotion of private enterprise. While the production and export of tea, rubber, coffee, sugar and other agricultural commodities remains important, the nation has moved steadily towards an industrialised economy with the development of food processing, textiles, telecommunications and finance. By 1996 plantation crops made up only 20% of export, and further declined to 16.8% in 2005 (compared with 93% in 1970), while textiles and garments have reached 63%. The GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.5% during the early 1990s, until a drought and a deteriorating security situation lowered growth to 3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in 1997\u20132000, with average growth of 5.3%. The year of 2001 saw the first recession in the country''s history, as a result of power shortages, budgetary problems, the global slowdown, and continuing civil strife.

During this time, a sapling of the Bodhi Tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment was brought to Sri Lanka and the first monasteries were established under the sponsorship of the Sri Lankan king.

Dr. Kannangara led the establishment of the Madhya Maha Vidyalayas (Central Schools) in different parts of the country in order to provide education to Sri Lanka''s rural population. In 1942 a special education committee proposed extensive reforms to establish an efficient and quality education system for the people.

In more recent times a British colonial culture was added, and lately Sri Lanka, particularly in the urban areas, has experienced a dramatic makeover in the western mold. Until recently, for example, most Sri Lankans, certainly those in the villages, have eaten traditional food, engaged in traditional crafts and expressed themselves through traditional arts. But economic growth and intense economic competition in developed countries has spilled over to most of Sri Lanka, producing changes that might variously be identified as progress, westernisation or a loss of identity and assimilation.\u000aTraditional food{{Main}}\u000a\u000aSri Lankans have added western influences to the customary diet such as rice and curry, pittu (mixture of fresh rice meal, very lightly roasted and mixed with fresh grated coconut, then steamed in a bamboo mould). Kiribath (cooked in thick coconut cream for this unsweetened rice-pudding which is accompanied by a sharp chili relish called "lunumiris"), wattalapam (rich pudding of Malay origin made of coconut milk, jaggery, cashew nuts, eggs, and various spices including cinnamon cloves and nutmeg), kottu, and hoppers ("appa"), batter cooked rapidly in a hot curved pan, accompanied by eggs, milk or savouries.  Middle Eastern influences and practices are found in traditional Moor dishes.

The elephant is paraded around the city bearing the tooth of Buddha. However the new year for tamils have been established as being on January 14 from this year.\u000aCinema\u000aSri Lankan cinema in past years has featured subjects such as family relationships, love stories and the years of conflict between the military and Tamil Tiger rebels. Many films are in the Sinhalese language and the Sri Lankan cinematic style is similar to bollywood, kollywood of Indian cinema.The first film to be produced and shown in Sri Lanka was Kadawunu Poronduwa (The Broken Promise) which was released in 1947. The first colour film of Sri Lanka was Ranmuthu Duwa.Afterwards there were many Sinhalese movies produced in Sri Lanka and some of them, such as Nidhanaya, received several international film awards. The most influential filmmaker in the history of Sri Lankan cinema is Lester James Peiris who has directed many movies of excellent quality which led to global acclaim. His latest film, Wekande Walauwa ("Mansion by the Lake") became the first movie to be submitted from Sri Lanka for the Best Foreign Language film award at the Academy Awards. In 2005 the director Vimukthi Jayasundara became the first Sri Lankan to win the prestigious Camera d\u2019Or award for Best First Film, or any award for that matter, at the Cannes Film Festival for his Sinhalese language film Sulanga Enu Pinisa (The Forsaken Land). Controversial filmmaker Asoka Handagama''s films are considered by many in the Sri Lankan film world to be the best films of honest response to the ethnic conflict raged in the country for many years. Prasanna Vithanage is one of Sri Lanka''s most notable filmmakers. His films have won many awards, both local and international. Recent releases like ''Sooriya Arana'', ''Samanala thatu'', and ''Hiripoda wessa'' have attracted Sri Lankans to cinemas. Sri Lankan films are usually in the Sinhalese language. Tamil language movies are also filmed in Sri Lanka but they are part of Kollywood which is Indian Tamil cinema. It is also known as Sri Lankan Tamil cinema in Sri Lanka. However some Kollywood films are based in Sri Lanka as well.\u000aMusic{{Main}}\u000aThe earliest music came from the theater at a time when the traditional open-air drama (referred to in Sinhala as Kolam, Sokari and Nadagam).

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(38,0,'{{For}}\u000aConservation biology is the scientific study of the nature and status of Earth''s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction.{{cite book}}{{cite journal}} It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on sciences, economics, and the practice of natural resource management.{{cite book}}{{cite book}}{{cite book}}{{cite book}} The term conservation biology was introduced as the title of a conference held at the University of California in La Jolla, California in 1978 organized by biologists Bruce Wilcox and Michael Soul\u00e9. The meeting was prompted by the concern among scientists over tropical deforestation, disappearing species, eroding genetic diversity within species.J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. J. Douglas. 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978. The conference and proceedings that resulted sought to bridge a gap existing at the time between theory in ecology and population biology on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soul\u00e9, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance conservation genetics as a new field at the time. Jared Diamond, who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and Thomas Lovejoy, who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at World Wildlife Fund, felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term conservation biology to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soul\u00e9 and Wilcox wrote in the program for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6\u20139, 1978, titled First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology, "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities. Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity (biodiversity) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy.The rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a "Discipline with a deadline"{{cite book}}. Conservation biology is tied closely to ecology in researching the dispersal, migration, demographics, effective population size, inbreeding depression, and minimum population viability of rare or endangered species. Conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity. The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years,{{cite journal}} which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Biodiversity Synthesis. World Resources Institute, Washington, DC.http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.354.aspx.pdf{{cite journal}}Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative affect this is having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. They are funded to research, monitor, and catalog every angle of the earth and its relation to society. The topics are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to the current biodiversity crisis based on morals, ethics, and scientific reason. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.\u000aContext and trendsConservation biologists study trends and process from the paleontological past to the ecological present as they gain an understanding of the context related to species extinction. It is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in Earth''s history. These include: the Ordovician (440 mya), Devonian (370 mya), Permian\u2013Triassic (245 mya), Triassic\u2013Jurassic (200 mya), and Cretaceous (65 mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the Earth''s ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost;{{cite book}} that is to say the rates of deforestation, reef destruction, wetland draining and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species. The latest Living Planet Report by the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that we have exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet, requiring 1.5 Earths to support the demands placed on our natural resources.http://www.panda.org/news_facts/publications/living_planet_report/\u000aSixth extinction{{Main}}\u000aConservation biologists are dealing with and have published evidence from all corners of the planet indicating that humanity may be living the sixth and greatest planetary extinction event.http://www.millenniumassessment.orgNational Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis - Scientific Experts Believe we are in the Midst of Fastest Mass Extinction in Earth''s History a "Biofact" from the American Natural History Museum''s website It has been suggested that we are living in an era of unprecedented numbers of species extinctions, also known as the Holocene extinction event.{{cite book}} The global extinction rate may be approximately 100,000 times higher than the natural background extinction rate.{{cite book}} It is estimated that two-thirds of all mammal genera and one-half of all mammal species weighing at least {{Convert}} have gone extinct in the last 50,000 years. It is speculated that this sixth extinction period is unique because it would be the first major extinction to be caused by another biotic agent over the course of the Earth''s 4 billion year history.{{cite journal}}Although controversial, small bands of hunters with primitive hunting technologies had the capability of driving Quaternary megafaunal extinctions: Turvey and Risley (2006) Modeling the extinction of Steller\u2019s sea cow.

The surviving populations are in continual decline in 43% of those that are threatened. Since the mid-1980s the actual rates of extinction have exceeded 211 times rates measured from the fossil record.M. L. McCallum. (2007). Amphibian Decline or Extinction? Current Declines Dwarf Background Extinction Rate. Journal of Herpetology, 41(3): 483\u2013491. https://www.herpconbio.org/~herpconb/McCallum/amphibian%20extinctions.pdf However, "The current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate for amphibians." The global extinction trend occurs in every major vertebrate group that is being monitored. For example, 23% of all mammals and 12% of all birds are Red Listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), meaning they too are threatened with extinction.\u000aStatus of oceans and reefs{{See also}}Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world''s coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. Coral bleaching is caused by a mixture of environmental stresses, including increases in ocean temperatures and acidity, causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals.{{cite book}} Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years. The loss of coral reefs, which are predicted to go extinct in the next century, will have huge economic impacts, threatens the balance of global biodiversity, and endangers food security for hundreds of millions of people.{{cite journal}}  Conservation biology plays an important role in international agreements covering the world''s oceans (and other issues pertaining to biodiversity, e.g. http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/M-7.01///en?page=1).{{quote box}}The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO2 levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic natural resources. A concern is that the majority of all marine species will not be able to evolve or acclimate in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.The Royal Society. 2005. Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policy document 12/05. ISBN 0 85403 617 2 DownloadThe prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately \u226550 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean" are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving multi-cellular organisms with only microbes left to dominate marine ecosystems.\u000aInsects and other groupsThere are serious concerns also being hailed from taxonomic groups that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates do, including fungi, lichen, plant and insect{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}} communities where the vast majority of biodiversity is represented. Insect conservation, in particular, is of pivotal importance for conservation biology. The value of insects in the biosphere is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of species richness. The greatest bulk of biomass on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that oftentimes reacts negatively toward these aesthetically ''unpleasant'' creatures.Edward O. Wilson. 1987. The Little Things That Run the World (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates). Conservation Biology, 1(4):pp. 344-346 http://www.jstor.org/pss/2386020M. J. Samways. (1993). Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives. Biodiversity and Conservation, 2:258-282One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing honey bees (Apis mellifera). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or colony collapse disorder (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in a 16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 beekeepers across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. Pests, pesticides, and global warming are all being considered as possible causes.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}}Another highlight that links conservation biology to insects, forests, and climate change is the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic of British Columbia, Canada, which has infested {{convert}} of forested land since 1999.{{cite journal}} An action plan has been prepared by the Government of British Columbia to address this problem.http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfp/mountain_pine_beetle/actionplan/2006/Beetle_Action_Plan.pdf{{quote}}\u000a\u000a\u000aConservation biology of parasites{{Main}}\u000aA large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.\u000aThreats to biodiversityMany of the threats to biodiversity, including disease and climate change, are reaching inside borders of protected areas, leaving them ''not-so protected'' (e.g. Yellowstone National Park{{cite journal}}). Climate change, for example, is often cited as a serious threat in this regard, because there is a feedback loop between species extinction and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Ecosystems store and cycle large amounts of carbon to regulate global conditions.{{cite book}} The effects of global warming adds a catastrophic threat toward a mass extinction of global biological diversity. The extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 37 percent of all species by 2050,{{cite journal}}By 2050 Warming to Doom Million Species, Study Says or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years.Some of the most significant and insidious threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes include climate change, mass agriculture, deforestation, overgrazing, slash-and-burn agriculture, urban development, wildlife trade, light pollution and pesticide use.{{cite journal}}T.

Considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth, the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology.{{cite journal}}See also, {{cite journal}}{{quote box}}These figures do not imply, however, that human activities must necessarily cause irreparable harm to the biosphere. With conservation management and planning for biodiversity at all levels, from genes to ecosystems, there are examples where humans mutually coexist in a sustainable way with nature.G. Schmidt. 2005.

Conservation biologists measure and apply statistical measures of fossil records,http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/regan/Currencyandtempo.pdf rates of habitat loss, and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancyD.

The current background extinction rate is estimated to be one species every few years.{{cite journal}}The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth''s species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)Edward O. Wilson. 2000. On the Future of Conservation Biology. Conservation Biology, 14(1): 1-3 to how many have received a species binomial (estimated range: 1.5-8 million). Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting its existence. From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of vertebrates, 5% of invertebrates and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as endangered or threatened.IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from critically endangered or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.\u000aSystematic conservation planningSystematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:{{cite journal}}\u000a\u000aCompile data on the biodiversity of the planning region\u000aIdentify conservation goals for the planning region\u000aReview existing conservation areas\u000aSelect additional conservation areas\u000aImplement conservation actions\u000aMaintain the required values of conservation areas\u000a\u000aConservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for grant proposals or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.The Amphibian Conservation Action Plan is one example http://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf.See also: {{cite journal}}). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of Geographic Information Systems to assist in the decision making process.\u000aConservation biology as a professionThe Society for Conservation Biology is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as philosophy, law, economics, humanities, arts, anthropology, and education. Within biology, conservation genetics and evolution are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.{{quote box}}Is conservation biology an objective science when biologists advocate for an inherent value in nature? Do conservationists introduce bias when they support policies using qualitative description, such as habitat degradation, or healthy ecosystems? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of science, reason, logic, and values in their conservation management plans. This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach. Many conservation biologists, in addition to having a Bachelors of Science (or extensive natural experience) often receive professional accreditation during their career (e.g. http://www.apbbc.bc.ca/).There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.{{cite journal}} The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an adaptive management approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Programhttp://leopoldleadership.org/content/\u000aPreservation{{See also}}\u000aA preservationist differs from a conservation biologist through the principal of non-interference. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans. In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems.\u000aEthics and values{{See also}}Conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values. A conservationist researches biodiversity and reasons through a Resource Conservation Ethic http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Evh1UD3ZYWcC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=resource+conservation+ethic&ots=pK3JljX-PI&sig=aUpm1AbsZ3BLC1l5X8ioas3qbaw#PPA15,M1, which identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."{{Rp}}Some conservation biologists argue that nature has an intrinsic value that is independent of anthropocentric usefulness or utilitarianism. Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. Aldo Leopold was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists. His writing is oftentimes required reading for those in the profession.\u000aConservation priorities{{See also}}\u000aWhile most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of sustaining biodiversity,Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?". URL accessed July 30, 2006. there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving biodiversity hotspots, some scientists (e.g.G. W. Luck, G. C. Daily and P. R. Ehrlich. (2003). Population diversity and ecosystem services. 18, (7): 331-336 http://www.montana.edu/ecology/courses/biol447/lucketal.pdf) and conservation organizations, such as the Nature Conservancy, argue that it is more cost effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in biodiversity coldspots.In the paper referenced herein, the authors map biodiversity hotspots against ecosystem service values and show that published maps on biodiversity priority have a disproportionate share of ecosystem service value. W. R. Turner, K. Brandon, T. M. Brooks, R. Costanza, G. A. B. Da Fonseca, and R. Portela. 2007. Global Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. BioScience, 57(10): 868-873. http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Turner%20et%20al.%20BioSci.%202007.pdf The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution every species, they argue, is an ill advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.{{cite journal}}Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth''s surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."{{cite journal}}Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth''s ecosystems where biomass, not biodiversity, reigns supreme.{{cite journal}} It is estimated that 36% of the Earth''s surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the endemic species to qualify as biodiversity hotspot.{{cite journal}} Moreover, measures show that maximizing protections for biodiversity does not capture ecosystem services any better than targeting randomly chosen regions.{{cite journal}} Population level biodiversity (i.e. coldspots) are disappearing at a rate that is ten times that at the species level. The level of importance in addressing biomass versus endemism as a concern for conservation biology is highlighted in literature measuring the level of threat to global ecosystem carbon stocks that do not necessarily reside in areas of endemism. A hotspot priority approachThe Global Conservation Fund is an example of funding organization that excludes biodiversity coldspots in its strategic campaign. http://web.conservation.org/xp/gcf would not invest so heavily in places such as steppes, the Serengeti, the Arctic, or taiga. These areas contribute a great abundance of population (not species) level biodiversity{{cite journal}} and ecosystem services, including cultural value and planetary nutrient cycling.{{cite journal}}{{IUCN_3.1_navmap/full}}\u000aSummary of 2006 IUCN Red List categories.\u000a\u000aThose in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections.http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx The IUCN Red List categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale. This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass. Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary adaptability, and biomass.The following papers are examples of research showing the relationship between biodiversity, biomass, and ecosystem stability:http://nature.berkeley.edu/genomicswg/EE_twentyeight.pdf{{cite journal}} Both sides agree, however, that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature; the debate hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost effective way.\u000aEconomic values and natural capital\u000a{{See also}}Conservation biologists have started to collaborate with leading global economists to determine how to measure the wealth and services of nature and to make these values apparent in global market transactions.{{cite book}} This system of accounting is called natural capital and would, for example, register the value of an ecosystem before it is cleared to make way for development.R.

When the stock market registers a financial crisis, traders on Wall Street are not in the business of trading stocks for much of the planet''s living natural capital stored in ecosystems. There is no natural stock market with investment portfolios into sea horses, amphibians, insects, and other creatures that provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are valuable to society. The ecological footprint of society has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planet''s ecosystems by about 30&nbsp;percent, which is the same percentage of vertebrate populations that have registered decline from 1970 through 2005.{{cite web}}{{quote box}}The inherent natural economy plays an essential role in sustaining humanity,http://www.millenniumassessment.org/ including the regulation of global atmospheric chemistry, pollinating crops, pest control,{{cite news}} cycling soil nutrients, purifying our water supply, supplying medicines and health benefits,{{cite journal}} and unquantifiable quality of life improvements. There is a relationship, a correlation, between markets and natural capital, and social income inequity and biodiversity loss. This means that there are greater rates of biodiversity loss in places where the inequity of wealth is greatest{{cite journal}}Although a direct market comparison of natural capital is likely insufficient in terms of human value, one measure of ecosystem services suggests the contribution amounts to trillions of dollars yearly.Staff of World Resources Program.

While biodiversity and ecosystems are resilient, the danger of losing them is that humans cannot recreate many ecosystem functions through technological innovation.\u000a{{Clear}}\u000aStrategic species concepts\u000aKeystone species{{Main}}Some species, called a keystone species, form a central supporting hub in the ecosystem. The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species. The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the Steller''s Sea Cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) through its interaction with sea otters, sea urchins, and kelp. Kelp beds grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the food chain. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to overhunting, sea urchin populations grazed unrestricted on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller''s Sea Cow''s diet and hastened their demise.P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller\u2019s Sea Cow, Hydrodamalis gigas. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394 The sea otter is a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival.\u000aIndicator species{{Main}}An indicator species has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as amphibians with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to wetlands, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a miner''s canary. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities. Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forestsilviculture treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a pesticide may impart on the health of an ecosystem.Government regulators, consultants, or NGOs regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.{{cite journal}} It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and oftentimes unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997{{Rp}}).\u000aUmbrella and flagship species{{Main}}An example of an umbrella species is the Monarch butterfly, because of its lengthy migrations and aesthetic value. The Monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the Monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as flagship species, which are species, such as the Giant Panda, the Blue Whale, the tiger, the mountain gorilla and the Monarch butterfly, that capture the public''s attention and attract support for conservation measures.{{Clear}}\u000aHistory{{quote box}}\u000aNatural resource conservation{{See also}}Efforts to conserve and protect global biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.{{cite book}} Prior to the global conservation era, there was the coming of the age of conservation. Some historians have linked this with the 1916 National Parks Act, which included the ''use without impairment'' clause, sought by John Muir. This eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in Dinosaur National Monument in 1959.{{cite book}}Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community. This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "Tragedy of the Commons."{{cite journal}}Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection. For recent discussions, see: {{cite journal}}and {{cite journal}} From this principal, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict. For example, the Alaskan Tlingit peoples and the Haida of the Pacific Northwest had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of Sockeye Salmon. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew life-long details of each river and stream they managed.Mason, Rachel and Judith Ramos. (2004). Traditional Ecological Knowledge of Tlingit People concerning the Sockeye Salmon Fishery of the Dry Bay Area, A Cooperative Agreement Between Department of the Interior National Park Service and the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe, Final Report (FIS) Project 01-091, Yakutat, Alaska.http://www.ser.org/iprn/pdf/Elaine_Abraham.pdf There are numerous examples in history where cultures have followed rules, rituals, and organized practice with respect to communal natural resource management.{{cite book}}Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the Tao, Shinto, Hindu, Islamic and Buddhist traditions.{{cite book}} In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture land degradation: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left."Hamilton, E., and H. Cairns (eds). 1961. Plato: the collected dialogues. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ In the bible, through Moses, God commanded to let the land rest from cultivation every seventh year.The Bible, Leviticus, 25:4-5 Before the 18th century, however, much of European culture considered it a pagan view to admire nature. Wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised.{{cite book}} However, as early as AD 680 a wildlife sanctuary was founded on the Farne Islands by St Cuthbert in response to his religious beliefs.\u000aEarly naturalistsNatural history was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in Europe and North America. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in Germany, 250 in Great Britain, 250 in the United States, and 300 in France.{{cite book}} Preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development in the late 18th to early 20th century. The 19th century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors. Although his artistic works and romantic depiction of avian life inspired many bird enthusiasts and conservation organizations, the writings of John James Audubon, by modern standards, show insensitivity toward bird conservation as he shot and collected hundreds of specimens. Inspired by him, however, the first chapter of the Audubon Society started in 1905 for the purpose of protecting birds.http://www.audubon.org/centennial/timeline_intro.php#\u000aComing of the Age of ConservationThe modern concept of ecosystem services can be found in the late 19th century. "The utility of Natural History or its applicability to promote the material wealth of the State cannot be doubted. It was a great mistake to suppose that the subjects of Zoology, Botany, and Geology did not involve much that affects our comfort, convenience, health and wealth."Page 91, in C. D. Wilber. (1861). Transactions of the Illinois Natural History Society. Illinois Natural History Society. http://books.google.ca/books?id=NcQYAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&client=firefox-a However, the article continues and discusses the dread of agricultural pests and the utility of understanding their natural history for the purpose of facilitating their destruction.{{quote box}}By the early 1800s biogeography was ignited through efforts of Alexander von Humboldt, DeCandolle, Lyell and Darwin;Short history of biogeography and conservation biology their efforts, while important in relating species to their environments, were part of the naturalist tradition and fell short of conservation biology proper. Darwin, for example, hunted and shot birds and kept natural history cabinets in line with Victorian tradition.Modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 19th century Enlightenment period particularly in England and Scotland.{{Cite book}} A number of thinkers, among them notably Lord Monboddo, described the importance of "preserving nature"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in Christian theology.{{Clear}}\u000a20th century conservationIn the 20th century, actions in the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada emphasized the protection of habitat areas pursuant to visions of such people as John Muir, Theodore Roosevelt, and Aldo Leopold. While the Canadian nor the United Kingdom governments did not pioneer the creation of National Parks as the United States did in the late 19th century, there were many far-sighted civil servants who were dedicated to wildlife conservation and of notable mention. Some of these historical figures include Charles Gordon Hewitt http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm and James Harkin.For an review and introduction to the history of wildlife conservation and preservation in Canada, see {{cite book}}The term conservation came into use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as timber, fish, game, topsoil, pastureland, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of forests (forestry), wildlife (wildlife refuge), parkland, wilderness, and watersheds. Western Europe was the source of much 19th century progress for conservation biology, particularly the British Empire with the Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869. However, the United States made contributions to this field starting with thinking of Thoreau and taking form with the Forest Act of 1891, John Muir''s founding of the Sierra Club in 1892, the founding of the New York Zoological Society in 1895 and establishment of a series of national forests and preserves by Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 to 1909.http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html Environmental timeline 1890-1920Not until the mid 20th century did efforts arise to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in big cat conservation in South America led by the New York Zoological Society.A.R. Rabinowitz, Jaguar: One Man''s Battle to Establish the World''s First Jaguar Preserve, Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986) In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., Carl E. Akeley, Archie Carr and Archie Carr III is notable in this era.{{cite book}}Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr. Biographical summary{{Citation needed}} Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the Virunga Mountains and observed the mountain gorilla in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading Albert I of Belgium to act in defense of the mountain gorilla and establish Albert National Park (since renamed Virunga National Park) in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo.Akeley, C., 1923. In Brightest Africa New York, Doubleday. 188-249.By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the Endangered Species ActU.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office along with the Species at Risk Act (SARA) of Canada, Biodiversity Action Plans developed in Australia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species ActU.S. Endangered Species Act of 1966 with subsequent amendments (1966) and National Environmental Policy Act (1970),42 USC 4321 National Environmental Policy Act (2000): full text of the law which together injected major funding and protection measures to large scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0091-7648(199023)18%3A3%3C342%3ACAWEII%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23.In 1980 a significant development was the emergence of the urban conservation movement. A local organization was established in Birmingham, UK, a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a grassroots movement, its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement''s view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The Society for Conservation Biology originated in 1985.http://books.google.ca/books?id=Evh1UD3ZYWcC&pg=PA2&dq=Fred+Van+Dyke+The+History+and+Distinctions+of+Conservation+Biology&client=firefox-a#PPA2,M1By 1992 most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the Convention on Biological Diversity;Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page subsequently many countries began programmes of Biodiversity Action Plans to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management and the Society for the Environment.Since 2000 the concept of landscape scale conservation has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationist, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.Ecology has clarified the workings of the biosphere; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The burgeoning human population and associated agriculture, industry, and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.{{cite book}}{{cquote}}\u000aSee also{{Portal box}}\u000a{{Div col}}\u000a\u000aApplied ecology\u000aBird observatory\u000aBiodiversity\u000aConservation ethic\u000aConservation movement\u000aConservation reliant species\u000aEndangered species\u000aEnvironmental protection\u000aEx-situ conservation\u000aExtinction\u000aGene pool\u000aGenetic erosion\u000aGenetic pollution\u000aHabitat fragmentation\u000aHolocene Mass Extinction\u000aIn-situ conservation\u000aIUCN Red List\u000aList of basic biology topics\u000aList of biology topics\u000aList of biological websites\u000aList of conservation topics\u000aNatural environment\u000aNatural history\u000aOverexploitation\u000aRegional Red List\u000aRenewable resource\u000aSilviculture\u000aSociety for Conservation Biology\u000aTyranny of small decisions\u000aWater conservation\u000aWildlife\u000aWildlife disease\u000aWildlife management\u000aWorld Conservation Monitoring Centre\u000aWorld Forestry Congress\u000a{{Div col end}}\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading{{Further reading cleanup}}\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExternal links\u000a\u000aConservation Biology Institute (CBI)\u000aUnited Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC)\u000aConservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES)\u000aThe Center for Biodiversity and Conservation - (American Museum of Natural History)\u000a{{Sep entry}}\u000aDictionary of the History of Ideas\u000aConservation evidence.com - Free access to conservation studies\u000a\u000a{{Biology-footer}}{{DEFAULTSORT:Conservation Biology}}\u000aar:\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062d\u0641\u0627\u0638\u000aca:Biologia de la conservaci\u00f3\u000ada:Bevarings\u00f8kologi\u000ade:Naturschutzbiologie\u000aes:Biolog\u00eda de la conservaci\u00f3n\u000afa:\u0632\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u200c\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0633\u06cc \u0628\u0642\u0627\u000afr:Biologie de la conservation\u000ais:Verndunarl\u00edffr\u00e6\u00f0i\u000aht:Kons\u00e8vasyon\u000ahu:Term\u00e9szetv\u00e9delmi biol\u00f3gia\u000aja:\u4fdd\u5168\u751f\u614b\u5b66\u000apt:Biologia da conserva\u00e7\u00e3o\u000asl:Varstvena biologija\u000asv:Bevarandebiologi','Conservation biology','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology')
INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(39,0,'The Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) was founded in 2004 by philosopher Nick Bostrom and bioethicist James Hughes. Incorporated in the United States as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, the IEET is a self-described "technoprogressive think tank" that seeks to contribute to understanding of the likely impact of emerging technologies on individuals and societies. It proposes to do so by "promoting and publicizing the work of thinkers who examine the social implications of scientific and technological advance". A number of such thinkers are offered honorary positions as IEET Fellows. The institute also aims to influence the development of public policies that distribute the benefits and reduce the risks of technological change.{{cite paper}} The IEET works with Humanity Plus, an international non-governmental organization with a similar mission but with an activist rather than academic approach. Humanity Plus was also founded and chaired by Dr. Bostrom, and formerly served by Dr. Hughes as its executive director. However, unlike the Humanity Plus, the founders of the IEET argue that it is not a transhumanist organization. Individuals who have accepted appointments as Fellows with the IEET support the institute''s mission, but they have expressed a wide range of views about emerging technologies and not all identify themselves as transhumanists.The IEET publishes an on-line, peer reviewed, academic journal entitled, the Journal of Evolution and Technology at the JET Press website. The JET was previously known as the Journal of Transhumanism, but changed its name and focus in order to expand its contributorship to include those who do not self-identify with the ideology.{{cite web}}In late May 2006, the IEET held the Human Enhancement Technologies and Human Rights conference at the Stanford University Law School in Stanford, California.{{cite web}}\u000aProgramsIn 2006, the IEET launched the following programs of activity:{{cite web}}\u000a\u000aSecuring the Future: Identification and advocacy for global solutions to threats to the future of civilization.\u000aRights of the Person: Campaign to deepen and broaden the concept of human rights. \u000aLonger, Better Lives: Case for longer healthier lives, addressing objections to life extension, challenge ageist and ableist attitudes that discourage the full utilization of health technology.\u000aEnvisioning the Future: Collection of images of posthumanity and non-human intelligence, positive, negative and neutral, e.g. in science fiction and popular culture; engagement with cultural critics, artists, writers, and filmmakers in exploring the lessons to be derived from these.\u000a\u000a\u000aReactionsThe origins and activities of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies have elicited various reactions:{{quotation}}{{quotation}}\u000aSee alsoDirectors\u000a\u000aGeorge Dvorsky\u000aGiulio Prisco \u000aJames Hughes\u000aNick Bostrom\u000a\u000aFellows\u000a\u000aAubrey de Grey\u000aDouglas Rushkoff\u000aJamais Cascio\u000aRussell Blackford\u000aMark Alan Walker\u000aMarshall Brain\u000aRamez Naam\u000aRiccardo Campa\u000aWrye Sententia\u000a\u000aAdvisors\u000a\u000aMartine Rothblatt\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aExternal links\u000a\u000aInstitute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies\u000aJournal for Evolution and Technology\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a','Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Ethics_and_Emerging_Technologies')
INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(40,0,'{{Article issues}}The culture of Europe might better be described as a series of overlapping cultures. Whether it is a question of North as opposed to South; West as opposed to East; Christianity as opposed to Islam; Protestantism as opposed to Catholicism; many have claimed to identify cultural fault lines across the continent. There are many cultural innovations and movements, often at odds with each other, such as Christian proselytism or Humanism. Thus the question of "common culture" or "common values" is far more complex than it seems to be.The foundation of European culture was laid by the Greeks, strengthened by the Romans, stabilized by Christianity, reformed and modernized by the fifteenth-century Renaissance and Reformation and globalized by successive European empires between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, including predominantly Muslim Ottoman Turks. Thus the European Culture developed into a very complex phenomenon of wider range of philosophy, Islamic mysticism, Christian and secular humanism, rational way of life and logical thinking developed through a long age of change and formation with the experiments of enlightenment, naturalism, romanticism, science, democracy, and socialism. Because of its global connection, the European culture grew with an all-inclusive urge to adopt, adapt and ultimately influence other trends of culture. As a matter of fact, therefore, from the middle of the nineteenth century with the expansion of European education and the spread of Christianity, European culture and way of life, to a great extent, turned to be "global culture," if anything has to be so named (Vide. Sailen Debnath, "Secularism: Western and Indian," Atlantic Publishers, New Delhi).\u000aArt{{Main}}\u000a\u000aPainting\u000a{{Main}}\u000aThe oldest known paintings are at the Grotte Chauvet in France, claimed by some historians{{Who}} to be about 32,000 years old. The history of Western painting represents a continuous, though disrupted, tradition from antiquity. Until the mid 19th century it was primarily concerned with representational and Classical modes of production, after which time more modern, abstract and conceptual forms gained favor. Developments in Western painting historically parallel those in Eastern painting, in general a few centuries later. African art, Islamic art, Indian art, Chinese art, and Japanese art each had significant influence on Western art, and, eventually, vice-versa.\u000a\u000aSculpture\u000a{{Main}}\u000aThe earliest European sculpture to date portrays a female form, and has been estimated at dating from 35,000 years ago. See Classical sculpture, Ancient Greek sculpture, Gothic art, Renaissance, Mannerist, Baroque, Neoclassicism, Modernism, Postminimalism, found art, Postmodern art, Conceptual art.\u000a\u000aMusic\u000aClassical Music : Europe was the birthplace of classical music- notably, Austria, Germany, France, Hungary, Italy, and Russia. Important classical composers from Europe include J.S. Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Liszt, Chopin, Wagner, Rimsky-Korsakov, Bruckner, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Mahler, Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Bartok, Sibelius, Prokofiev, Puccini, Debussy, Rossini, Ravel, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. Luciano Pavarotti was a contemporary popular opera singer. Orchestras such as the Berliner Philharmoniker, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra are considered to be amongst the finest ensembles in the world. The Salzburg Festival, the Bayreuth Festival, the Edinburgh International Festival and the BBC Proms are major European classical music festivals.\u000aFolk Music : Europe has a wide and diverse range of indigenous music, sharing common features in rural, travelling or maritime communities. Folk music is embedded in an unwritten, aural tradition, but was increasingly transcribed from the nineteenth century onwards. Many classical composers used folk melodies, and folk has influenced some popular music in Europe.\u000aPopular Music : Europe has also imported many different genres of music, mainly from America, ranging from  Blues, Jazz, Soul, Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop, R&#39;n&#39;B, Dance, etc. UK has been most successful in re-exporting this type of music and creating many of its own genres with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Queen, Elton John, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Deep Purple, Sex Pistols, Eric Clapton, The Clash, Van Morrison, Dire Straits, Fleetwood Mac, Genesis, George Michael, Pet Shop Boys, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, The Who, Eurythmics, Dusty Springfield, The Cure, Black Sabbath, Def Leppard, Duran Duran, Iron Maiden, Radiohead, Oasis, Coldplay, The Police, Robbie Williams, Bee Gees, Spice Girls, UB40, Amy Winehouse, Jay Sean, Leona Lewis...

Austria: Sigmund Frued.\u000aPhilosophy{{Main}}\u000aEuropean philosophy is a predominant strand of philosophy globally, and is central to philosophical enquiry in America and most other parts of the world which have fallen under its influence. Christian thought is a huge influence on many fields of European philosophy (as European philosophy has been on Christian thought too), sometimes as a reaction; the Greek schools of philosophy in antiquity provide the basis of philosophical discourse that extends to today.Perhaps one of the most important single philosophical periods since the classical era were the Renaissance, the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment. There are many disputes as to its value and even its timescale. What is indisputable is that the tenets of reason and rational discourse owe much to Ren\u00e9 Descartes, John Locke and others working at the time.  Other important European philosophical strands include:\u000aAnalytic philosophy, Calvinism, Christian Democracy, Communism, Conservatism, Constructionism, Deconstructionism, Empiricism, Epicureanism, Existentialism, Fascism, Humanism, Idealism, Liberalism, Logical positivism, Marxism, Materialism, Monarchism, Nationalism, Perspectivism, Platonism, Positivism, Postmodernism, Rationalism, Romanticism, Scepticism, Scholasticism, Social Democracy, Socialism, Stoicism, Structuralism, Thomism, Utilitarianism, Spenglerism\u000aReligion{{Main}}\u000aChristianity has been the dominant feature in shaping up European culture for at least the last 1700 years. Modern philosophical thought has very much been influenced by Christian philosophers such as St Thomas Aquinas and Erasmus.\u000aMillions of Europeans profess no religion or are atheist or agnostic. The largest non-confessional populations (as a percentage) are found in Sweden, the Czech Republic and France although most former communist countries have significant non-confessional populations. Attendance at church is a minority activity in most Western European countries - as an example, the Church of England attracts around 1 million worshippers on a Sunday,Anglican.org which corresponds to about 2% of the population of England.The most popular religions of Europe are the following:\u000a\u000aChristianity\u000aRoman Catholicism: Countries or areas with significant Catholic populations are Portugal, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, southern Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, southern Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Malta, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, the Croatian parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, western and central Belarus, western Ukraine, The Hungarian parts of Romania, parts of Russia, Latgale region of Latvia, and Lithuania. There are also large Catholic minorities in England and Wales.\u000aOrthodox Christianity: The countries with significant Orthodox populations are Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland (Karelia), Georgia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine.\u000aProtestantism: Countries with significant Protestant populations include Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, the UK, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. There are significant minorities in France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, and indeed small minorities in most European Countries. \u000aIslam: Countries with significant Muslim population are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo, several republics of Russia, Crimea in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Also, {{As of}}, about 5% of the EU identify themselves as Muslims, with many Muslim immigrants in Germany, the UK, Sweden and France.{{Citation needed}}\u000a\u000aOther minor religions exist in Europe, some brought by migrants, including:\u000a\u000aJudaism, mainly in France, UK and Russia.\u000aHinduism, mainly among Indian immigrants in the UK.\u000aBuddhism, thinly spread throughout Europe, yet it is in Kalmykia, Russia\u000aIndigenous European pagan traditions and beliefs, many countries.\u000aRastafari, communities in the UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and elsewhere.\u000aSikhism and Jainism, both mainly among Indian immigrants in the UK.\u000aWest African Vodun and Haitian Vodou (Voodoo), mainly among West African and black Caribbean immigrants in the UK and France.\u000aTraditional African Religions (including Muti), mainly in the UK and France. \u000a\u000a\u000aOfficial religionsA number of countries in Europe have official religions, including Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Vatican City (Catholic); and Greece (Eastern Orthodox), Denmark, Iceland and Norway (Lutheran). In Switzerland, some cantons are officially Catholic, others Reformed Protestant. Some Swiss villages even have their religion as well as the village name written on the signs at their entrances. In Bulgaria, an article in the constitution defines Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the country''s "traditional religion".Georgia has no established church, but the Georgian Orthodox Church enjoys "de facto" privileged status. In Finland, both Finnish Orthodox Church and Lutheran church are official. Russia recognises Eastern Orthodoxy, Islam, Buddhism and Judaism as all "traditional" {{Citation needed}} (with three states, Kalmykia, Buryatia and Tuva, officially Buddhist {{Citation needed}}). England, a country in the UK, has Anglicanism as its official religion.\u000aCuisine{{Main}}\u000aThe cuisines of Western countries are diverse by themselves, although there are common characteristics that distinguishes Western cooking from cuisines of Asian countries and others. Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving-size. Steak in particular is a common dish across the West. Similarly to some Asian cuisines, Western cuisines also put substantial emphasis on sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments (in part due to the difficulty of seasonings penetrating the often larger pieces of meat used in Western cooking). Many dairy products are utilized in the cooking process, except in nouvelle cuisine. Wheat-flour bread has long been the most common sources of starch in this cuisine, along with pasta, dumplings and pastries, although the potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonization of the Americas.\u000aClothing{{Main}}\u000aThe earliest definite examples of needles originate from the Solutrean culture, which existed in France from 19,000 BC to 15,000 BC. The earliest dyed flax fibers have been found in a cave the Republic of Georgia and date back to 36,000 BP. see Clothing in ancient Rome, 1100-1200 in fashion, 1200-1300 in fashion, 1300-1400 in fashion, 1400-1500 in fashion, 1500-1550 in fashion, 1550-1600 in fashion, 1600-1650 in fashion, 1650-1700 in fashion, Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution.\u000aSport{{Main}}\u000aEurope''s influence on sport is enormous. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a modern sport, apart from basketball and related sports, that does not have its origins in Europe. European sports include:\u000a\u000aAssociation football, which has contested origins between Britain and Italy (where Mussolini insisted the game be called by the name Calcio). What is uncontestable is that the oldest association is The Football Association of England (1863) and the first international match was between Scotland and England (1872). It is now the world&#39;s most popular sport and is played throughout Europe.\u000aCricket has its origins in south east Britain. It&#39;s popular throughout England and Wales, and parts of Netherlands. It is also popular in other areas and also played in northwest Europe. It is however very popular worldwide, especially in Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the Indian subcontinent.\u000aCycling, which is immensely popular as a means of transport has most of its sporting adherents in Europe, particularly Western Europe. The Tour de France is the world&#39;s most watched live annual sporting event. The bicycle itself is probably from France (see History of the bicycle). \u000aThe discus throw, javelin throw and shot put have their origins in ancient Greece. The Olympics, both ancient and modern, have their origins too in Europe, and have a massive influence globally.\u000aField Hockey as a modern game began in 18th Century Britain with Ireland having the oldest federation. It is popular in Western Europe, the Indian subcontinent, Australia and East Asia.  Ice hockey, popular in Europe and North America may derive from this sport.\u000aGolf, one of the most popular sports in Europe, Asia and North America, has its origins in Scotland, with the oldest course being at Musselburgh.\u000aHandball, which is popular in Europe and elsewhere, has its origins in antiquity. The modern game is from northern Europe with Germany having been involved in both the first women&#39;s and men&#39;s internationals.\u000aRugby League and Rugby Union which both have similar origins to football. Rugby Union is the older of the two codes and has rules that date from 1845 (see articles: History of rugby league and History of rugby union). They acrimoniously split in the late 19th century over the treatment of injured players. Rugby league gradually changed its laws over the next century with the end result that today both sports have little in common, apart from the basics. They have both been carried abroad by colonization, particularly to many former British colonies. American football and Canadian Football are derivatives of rugby.  \u000aTennis which originates from United Kingdom and related games such as Table Tennis derive from the game Real Tennis which is from France.

Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.Ernst Breisach, Introduction to Modern Existentialism, New York (1962), page 5Walter Kaufmann, Existentialism: From Dostoevesky to Sartre, New York (1956), page 12 Existentialism became fashionable in the post-World War years as a way to reassert the importance of human individuality and freedom.Guignon, Charles B. and Derk Pereboom. Existentialism: basic writings (Hackett Publishing, 2001, page xiii)\u000aHistoryExistentialism is foreshadowed most notably by 19th-century philosophers S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, though it had forerunners in earlier centuries. In the 20th century, the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (starting from Husserl''s phenomenology) influenced other existentialist philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and (absurdist) Albert Camus. Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Franz Kafka also described existential themes in their literary works. Although there are some common tendencies amongst "existentialist" thinkers, there are major differences and disagreements among them (most notably the divide between atheist existentialists like Sartre and theistic existentialists like Paul Tillich); not all of them accept the validity of the term as applied to their own work.Walter Kaufmann. Existentialism: From Dostoevsky to Sartre. (Cleveland: The World Publishing Company, 1956) 11\u000aOriginsThe term "existentialism" seems to have been coined by the French philosopher Gabriel Marcel in the mid-1940sD.E. Cooper Existentialism: A Reconstruction (Basil Blackwell, 1990, page 1)Thomas R. Flynn, Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2006, page 89Christine Daigle, Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics (McGill-Queen''s press, 2006, page 5) and adopted by Jean-Paul Sartre who, on October 29, 1945, discussed his own existentialist position in a lecture to the Club Maintenant in Paris. The lecture was published as L''existentialisme est un humanisme, a short book which did much to popularize existentialist thought.L''Existentialisme est un Humanisme (Editions Nagel, 1946); English Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism and Humanism (Eyre Methuen, 1948)The label has been applied retrospectively to other philosophers for whom existence and, in particular, human existence were key philosophical topics.  Martin Heidegger had made human existence (Dasein) the focus of his work since the 1920s, and Karl Jaspers had called his philosophy "Existenzphilosophie" in the 1930s.John Potevi, A Dictionary of Continental Philosophy (Yale University press, 2006, page 325)  Both Heidegger and Jaspers had been influenced by the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. For Kierkegaard the crisis of human existence had been a major theme.S. Kierkegaard, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, "A First and Last Declaration": "...to read solo the original text of the individual, human-existence relationship, the old text, well known, handed down from the fathers, to read it through yet once more, if possible in a more heartfelt way."Michael Weston, Kierkegaard and Modern Continental Philosophy (Routledge, 2003, page 35) He came to be regarded as the first existentialist, and has been called the "father of existentialism". In fact he was the first to explicitly make existential questions a primary focus in his philosophy.Ferreira, M. Jamie, Kierkegaard, Wiley & Sons, 2008. In retrospect, other writers have also implicitly discussed existentialist themes throughout the history of philosophy and literature. Due to the exposure of existentialist themes over the decades, when society was officially introduced to existentialism, the term became quite popular almost immediately.Examples include:\u000a\u000aBuddha&#39;s teachings,Mulder Jr., Jack. Mystical And Buddhist Elements in Kierkegaard''s Religious Thought, Edwin Mellen Press, 2006\u000aSaint Augustine in his Confessions,Storm, D. Anthony.

Princeton University Press, 1980\u000a\u000a\u000a19th century\u000aAs early as 1835 in a letter to his friend Peter Wilhelm Lund, the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard wrote one of his first existentially sensitive passages. In it, he describes a truth that is applicable for him:{{quote}}The early thoughts of Kierkegaard would be formalized in his prolific philosophical and theological writings, many of which would later form the modern foundation of 20th century existentialism.Marino, Gordon. Ed. Basic Writings of Existentialism. Modern Library, 2004.\u000aKierkegaard and Nietzsche{{Main}}\u000aS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term "existentialism" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like Pascal, they were interested in people''s quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.Luper, Steven. "Existing". Mayfield Publishing, 2000, p.4\u20135Ibid, p. 11  Kierkegaard''s knight of faith and Nietzsche''s \u00dcbermensch are exemplars who define the nature of their own existence. These idealized individuals invent their own values and create the very terms under which they excel. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including postmodernism, nihilism, and various strands of psychology.\u000aDostoyevsky and KafkaTwo of the first literary authors important to existentialism were the Czech Franz Kafka and the Russian Fyodor Dostoevsky.Hubben, William. Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Kafka, Scribner, 1997. Dostoevsky''s Notes from Underground portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. Others of Dostoevsky''s novels covered issues raised in existential philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in Crime and Punishment the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoevsky himself.Kafka created surreal and alienated characters who struggle with hopelessness and absurdity, notably in his most famous novella, The Metamorphosis, or in his master novel, The Trial. In his philosophical essay The Myth of Sisyphus, the French existentialist/absurdist Albert Camus describes Kafka''s oeuvre as "absurd in principle",Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus (Trans. Justin O''Brien, Hamish Hamilton, 1955, page 104) but he finds the same "tremendous cry of hope" expressed by religious existentialists such as Kierkegaard and Shestov \u2014which Camus rejects.Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus 1955, page 107)\u000a\u000aEarly 20th centuryIn the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers had explored existential ideas, the only difference was in the name.\u000aThe Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, in his 1913 book The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations, emphasized the life of "flesh and bone" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual''s quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in Cervantes'' fictional character Don Quixote. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno''s short story about a priest''s crisis of faith, "Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr" has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, Ortega y Gasset, writing in 1914, held that the human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: "Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia" ("I am myself and my circumstances"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated ("en situaci\u00f3n").Although Martin Buber wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and Frankfurt, he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in Zionism and Hasidism. In 1938, he moved permanently to Jerusalem. His best-known philosophical work was the short book I and Thou, published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is "man with man", a dialogue which takes place in the so-called "sphere of between" ("das Zwischenmenschliche").Maurice S. Friedman, Martin Buber. The Life of Dialogue (University of Chicago press, 1955, page 85)Two Ukrainian/Russian thinkers, Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev became well-known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms All Things Are Possible.Berdyaev, also from Kiev but with a background in the Eastern Orthodox Church, drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom.  "Man" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God''s image, an originator of free, creative acts.Ernst Breisach, Introduction to Modern Existentialism, New York (1962), pages 173\u2013176 He published a major work on these themes, The Destiny of Man, in 1931.Gabriel Marcel, long before coining the term "existentialism", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay "Existence and Objectivity" (1925) and in his Metaphysical Journal (1927).Samuel M. Keen, "Gabriel Marcel" in Paul Edwards (ed.) The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (Macmillan Publishing Co, 1967)  A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alientation; the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through "secondary reflection", a "dialogical" rather than "dialectical" approach to the world, characterized by "wonder and astonishment" and open to the "presence" of other people and of God rather than merely to "information" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted "extravagant" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.John Macquarrie, Existentialism (Pelican, 1973, page 110)Marcel contrasted "secondary reflection" with abstract, scientific-technical "primary reflection" which he associated with the activity of the abstract Cartesian ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate \u2014 embodied \u2014 in a concrete world.John Macquarrie, Existentialism (Pelican, 1973, page 96)  Although Jean-Paul Sartre adopted the term "existentialism" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel''s thought has been described as "almost diametrically opposed" to that of Sartre.  Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.In Germany, the psychologist and philosopher Karl Jaspers \u2014 who later described existentialism as a "phantom" created by the public,Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, page 75/11) \u2014 called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche \u2014 Existenzphilosophie. For Jaspers, "Existenz-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker."Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, page 40)Jaspers, a professor at the University of Heidelberg, was acquainted with Martin Heidegger, who held a professorship at Marburg before acceding to Husserl''s chair at Freiburg in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger''s support of National Socialism. They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard,Karl Jaspers, "Philosophical Autobiography" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, page 75/2 and following) and in the 1930s Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In Being and Time he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (Dasein) to be analysed in terms of existential categories (existentiale); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.\u000aAfter the Second World WarFollowing the Second World War, existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts. These years also saw the growing reputation outside Germany of Heidegger''s book Being and Time.\u000a\u000aSartre had dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel Nausea and the short stories in his 1939 collection The Wall, and had published a major philosophical statement, Being and Nothingness in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates \u2014 Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others \u2014 became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism.Ronald Aronson, Camus and Sartre (University of Chicago Press, 2004, chapter 3 passim) In a very short space of time, Camus and Sartre in particular, became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 "a fame that reached across all audiences."Ronald Aronson, Camus and Sartre (University of Chicago Press, 2004, page 44)  Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former French Resistance) newspaper Combat; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, Les Temps Modernes, and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and humanism to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant. Beauvoir wrote that "not a week passed without the newspapers discussing us";Simone de Beauvoir, Force of Circumstance, quoted in Ronald Aronson, Camus and Sartre (University of Chicago Press, 2004, page 48) existentialism became "the first media craze of the postwar era."Ronald Aronson, Camus and Sartre (University of Chicago Press, 2004, page 48)By the end of 1947, Camus'' earlier fiction and plays had been reprinted, his new play Caligula had been performed and his novel The Plague published; the first two novels of Sartre''s The Roads to Freedom trilogy had appeared, as had Beauvoir''s novel The Blood of Others. Works by Camus and Sartre were already appearing in foreign editions. The Paris-based existentialists had become famous.Sartre had travelled to Germany in 1930 to study the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger,R\u00fcdiger Safranski, Martin Heidgger \u2014 Between Good and Evil (Harvard University Press, 1998, page 343 and he included critical comments on their work in his major treatise Being and Nothingness. Heidegger''s thought had also become known in French philosophical circles through its use by Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve in explicating Hegel in a series of lectures given in Paris in the 1930s.Entry on Koj\u00e8ve in Martin Cohen (editor), The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics(Hodder Arnold, 2006, page 158); see also Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit (Cornell University Press, 1980)  The lectures were highly influential; members of the audience included not only Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, but Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Louis Althusser, Andr\u00e9 Breton and Jacques Lacan.Entry on Koj\u00e8ve in Martin Cohen (editor), The Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics(Hodder Arnold, 2006, page 158)  A selection from Heidegger''s Being and Time was published in French in 1938, and his essays began to appear in French philosophy journals.\u000a\u000aHeidegger read Sartre''s work and was initially impressed, commenting:  "Here for the first time I encountered an independent thinker who, from the foundations up, has experienced the area out of which I think, Your work shows such an immediate comprehension of my philosophy as I have never before encountered."Martin Hediegger, letter, quoted in R\u00fcdiger Safranski, Martin Heidgger \u2014 Between Good and Evil (Harvard University Press, 1998, page 349) Later, however, in response to a question posed by his French follower Jean Beaufret,R\u00fcdiger Safranski, Martin Heidgger \u2014 Between Good and Evil (Harvard University Press, 1998, page 356) Heidegger distanced himself from Sartre''s position and existentialism in general in his Letter on Humanism.William J. Richardson, Martin Heidegger: From Phenomenology to Thought (Martjinus Nijhoff,1967, page 351)  Heidegger''s reputation continued to grow in France during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, Sartre attempted to reconcile existentialism and Marxism in his work Critique of Dialectical Reason. A major theme throughout his writings was freedom and responsibility.Albert Camus was a friend of Sartre, until their falling-out, and wrote several works with existential themes including The Rebel, The Stranger, The Myth of Sisyphus, and Summer in Algiers. Camus, like many others, rejected the existentialist label, and considered his works to be concerned with people facing the absurd. In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it.  The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existential philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger and Jaspers.Simone de Beauvoir, an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre''s partner, wrote about feminist and existential ethics in her works, including The Second Sex and The Ethics of Ambiguity. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre, de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.Frantz Fanon, a Martiniquan-born critic of colonialism, has been considered an important existentialist.Macey, David. Franz Fanon: a Biography. New York City: Picador, USA. p. 129\u2013130.Paul Tillich, an important existential theologian following S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, applied existential concepts to Christian theology, and helped introduce existential theology to the general public. His seminal work The Courage to Be follows Kierkegaard''s analysis of anxiety and life''s absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern man must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life''s absurdity. Rudolf Bultmann used Kierkegaard''s and Heidegger''s philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existential concepts.Maurice Merleau-Ponty, an existential phenomenologist, was for a time a companion of Sartre. His understanding of Husserl''s phenomenology was far greater than that of Merleau-Ponty''s fellow existentialists. It has been said that his work, Humanism and Terror, greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir, who sided with Sartre.Colin Wilson, an English writer, published his study The Outsider in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. Introduction to the New Existentialism), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.K. Gunnar Bergstr\u00f6m, An Odyssey to Freedom University of Uppsala, 1983, page 92;Colin Stanley, Colin Wilson, a Celebration: Essays and Recollections Cecil Woolf, 1988, page 43)\u000aConcepts\u000aFocus on concrete existenceExistentialist thinkers focus on the question of concrete human existence and the conditions of this existence rather than hypothesizing a human essence, stressing that the human essence is determined through life choices. However, even though the concrete individual existence must have priority in existentialism, certain conditions are commonly held to be "endemic" to human existence.What these conditions are is better understood in light of the meaning of the word "existence," which comes from the Latin "existere," meaning "to stand out." Man exists in a state of distance from the world that he nonetheless remains in the midst of. This distance is what enables man to project meaning into the disinterested world of in-itselfs. This projected meaning remains fragile, constantly facing breakdown for any reason \u2014 from a tragedy to a particularly insightful moment. In such a breakdown, we are put face to face with the naked meaninglessness of the world, and the results can be devastating.It is in relation to the concept of the devastating awareness of meaninglessness that Albert Camus claimed that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide" in his The Myth of Sisyphus. Although "prescriptions" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard''s religious "stage" to Camus'' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of quietism, which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.{{cite web}} It has been said that the possibility of suicide makes all humans existentialists.{{citation}}\u000aExistence precedes essence{{Main}}\u000aA central proposition of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, which means that the actual life of the individual is what constitutes what could be called his or her "essence" instead of there being a predetermined essence that defines what it is to be a human. Thus, the human being - through his consciousness - creates his own values and determines a meaning to his life.{{fr}} (Dictionary) "L''existencialisme" - see "l''identit\u00e9 de la personne"  Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of many existentialist philosophers, from Mulla Sadra,{{Cite book}} to Kierkegaard, to Heidegger.It is often claimed in this context that a person defines themselves, which is often perceived as stating that they can "wish" to be something \u2014 anything, a bird, for instance \u2014 and then be it. According to most existentialist philosophers, however, this would constitute an inauthentic existence. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that the person is (1) defined only insofar as he or she acts and (2) that he or she is responsible for his or her actions. For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (a cruel person). This is as opposed to their genes, or ''human nature'', bearing the blame.As Sartre puts it in his Existentialism is a Humanism: "man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world \u2013 and defines himself afterwards." Of course, the more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person. Here it is also clear that since man can choose to be either cruel or good, he is, in fact, neither of these things essentially.\u000a{{cite book}}\u000aAngstAngst, sometimes called dread, anxiety or even anguish is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypal example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that "nothing is holding me back", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one''s own freedom.It can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear which has an object. While in the case of fear, one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear, in the case of angst, no such "constructive" measures are possible. The use of the word "nothing" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one''s actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing one''s freedom as angst, one also realizes that one will be fully responsible for these consequences; there is no thing in a person (their genes, for instance) that acts in their stead, and that they can "blame" if something goes wrong.Not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread), but that doesn''t change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action. One of the most extensive treatments of the existentialist notion of Angst is found in S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard''s monumental work Begrebet Angest.\u000aFreedomThe existentialist concept of freedom is often misunderstood as a sort of liberum arbitrium where almost anything is possible and where values are inconsequential to choice and action. This interpretation of the concept is often related to the insistence on the absurdity of the world and the assumption that there exist no relevant or absolutely good or bad values. However, that there are no values to be found in the world in-itself does not mean that there are no values: We are usually brought up with certain values, and even though we cannot justify them ultimately, they will be "our" values.In Kierkegaard''s Judge Vilhelm''s account in Either/Or, making choices without allowing one''s values to confer differing values to the alternatives, is, in fact, choosing not to make a choice \u2014 to flip a coin, as it were, and to leave everything to chance. This is considered to be a refusal to live in the consequence of one''s freedom; an inauthentic existence. As such, existentialist freedom isn''t situated in some kind of abstract space where everything is possible: since people are free, and since they already exist in the world, it is implied that their freedom is only in this world, and that it, too, is restricted by it.What is not implied in this account of existential freedom, however, is that one''s values are immutable; a consideration of one''s values may cause one to reconsider and change them. A consequence of this fact is that one is not only responsible for one''s actions, but also for the values one holds. This entails that a reference to common values doesn''t excuse the individual''s actions: Even though these are the values of the society the individual is part of, they are also his own in the sense that she/he could choose them to be different at any time. Thus, the focus on freedom in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears as a result of one''s freedom: the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency, and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.\u000aFacticityA concept closely related to freedom is that of facticity, a concept defined by Sartre in Being and Nothingness as that "in-itself" of which humans are in the mode of not being. This can be more easily understood when considering it in relation to the temporal dimension of past: One''s past is what one is in the sense that it co-constitutes him (or her). However, to say that one is only one''s past would be to ignore a large part of reality (the present and the future) while saying that one''s past is only what one was in a way that would entirely detach it from them now. A denial of one''s own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a body (e.g. one that doesn''t allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound), identity, values, etc.).Facticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one''s facticity consists of things one couldn''t have chosen (birthplace, etc.), but a condition in the sense that one''s values most likely will depend on it. However, even though one''s facticity is "set in stone" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one''s facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other remembers everything. They have both committed many crimes, but the first man, knowing nothing about this, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for "trapping" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.However, to disregard one''s facticity when one, in the continual process of self-making, projects oneself into the future, would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and would thus be inauthentic. In other words, the origin of one''s projection will still have to be one''s facticity, although in the mode of not being it (essentially). Another aspect of facticity is that it entails angst, both in the sense that freedom "produces" angst when limited by facticity, and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to "step in" for one to take responsibility for something one has done also produces angst.\u000aAuthenticity and inauthenticityThe theme of authentic existence is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is often taken to mean that one has to "find oneself" and then live in accordance with this self. A common misunderstanding is that the self is something one can find if one looks hard enough, that one''s true self is substantial.What is meant by authenticity is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as One acts or as one''s genes or any other essence require. The authentic act is one that is in accordance with one''s freedom. Of course, as a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one''s facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one''s choices (in the sense that one could then blame one''s background for making the choice one made). The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one''s actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard''s Aesthete, "choosing" randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.In contrast to this, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one''s freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of determinism is true, to a sort of "mimicry" where one acts as "One should." How "One" should act is often determined by an image one has of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager) acts. This image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic: The main point is the attitude one takes to one''s own freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.\u000aDespairCommonly defined as a loss of hope,{{cite web}} Despair in existentialism is more specifically related to the reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the "pillars" of one''s self or identity. If one is invested in being a particular thing, a waiter or an "upstanding citizen," for example, and one finds oneself in a situation in which one has done something or had something happen to oneself that compromises this being-thing, one would normally find oneself in a state of despair, a hopeless state. An athlete who loses his legs in an accident may despair if he has nothing to "fall back on," for instance. One is confronted with the irreality of what one had taken to be one''s self.What sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the dictionary definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when one isn''t overtly in despair: As long as one has based one''s identity on such pillars so that one is vulnerable to having one''s world break down, one is considered to be in perpetual despair. And as, in Sartrean terms, there is no human essence based in reality from which to constitute one''s sense of identity, despair is a truly human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in his Either/or: "Any life-view with a condition outside it is despair."{{cite book}} In other words, it is possible to be in despair without despairing.\u000aThe Other and the LookThe Other (when written with a capital "o") is a concept more properly belonging to phenomenology and its account of intersubjectivity. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences), only from "over there", the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is "there" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same as them. This experience of the Other''s look is what is termed the Look (sometimes the Gaze).While this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other''s Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by them, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of one''s freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. As such, when one experiences oneself in the Look, one doesn''t experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something. Sartre''s own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this: at first, this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him, and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing, as a Peeping Tom. The Look is then co-constitutive of one''s facticity.Another characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn''t some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there). It is only one''s perception of the way another might perceive them.\u000aReasonEmphasizing action, freedom, and decision as fundamental, existentialists oppose themselves to rationalism and positivism. That is, they argue against definitions of human beings as primarily rational. Rather, existentialists look at where people find meaning. Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on the meaning to them rather than rationally. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of anxiety and dread that we feel in the face of our own radical freedom and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard saw strong rationality as a mechanism humans use to counter their existential anxiety, their fear of being in the world: "If I can believe that I am rational and everyone else is rational then I have nothing to fear and no reason to feel anxious about being free." {{Citation needed}} However, Kierkegaard advocated rationality as means to interact with the objective world (e.g. in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: "Human reason has boundaries".Soren Kierkegaard''s Journals and Papers Vol 5, p. 5Like Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of "bad faith", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena \u2014 "the Other" \u2014 that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserts, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by "the look" of "the Other" (i.e. possessed by another person \u2014 or at least one''s idea of that other person). In a similar vein, Camus believed that society and religion falsely teach humans that "the Other" has order and structure.Camus, Albert. "An Absurd Reasoning" For Camus, when an individual''s consciousness, longing for order, collides with the Other''s lack of order, a third element is born: absurdity.\u000aThe Absurd{{Main}}\u000aThe notion of the Absurd contains the idea that there is no meaning to be found in the world beyond what meaning we give to it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or "unfairness" of the world. This contrasts with "karmic" ways of thinking in which "bad things don''t happen to good people"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad thing; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a "good" person as to a "bad" person.Because of the world''s absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd. The notion of the absurd has been prominent in literature throughout history. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Franz Kafka, Fyodor Dostoevsky and many of the literary works of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus contain descriptions of people who encounter the absurdity of the world. Albert Camus studied the issue of "the absurd" in his essay The Myth of Sisyphus.\u000aRelation to Nihilism{{multiple issues}}\u000a{{Expert-verify}}\u000aThough nihilism and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another. A primary cause of confusion is that Friedrich Nietzsche is an important philosopher in both fields, but also the existentialist insistence on the absurd and the inherent meaninglessness of the world. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of Angst as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to a moral or an existential nihilism. A pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in Camus'' The Myth of Sisyphus, and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one''s self-created meaning: Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he wouldn''t himself agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and Sartre''s final words in Being and Nothingness are "All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work."Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness, Routledge Classics (2003). Hence, existentialists believe that one can create value and meaning, whilst nihilists will deny this.\u000aCriticism\u000aHerbert Marcuse criticised Existentialism, especially Being and Nothingness (1943), by Jean-Paul Sartre, for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory".Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre''s Existentialism". Printed in Studies in Critical Philosophy. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161 In 1946, Sartre already had replied to Marxist criticism of Existentialism in the lecture Existentialism is a humanism.{{cite web}} In Jargon of Authenticity, Theodor Adorno criticised Heidegger''s philosophy, especially his use of language, as a mystifying ideology of advanced, industrial society, and its power structure. {{Citation needed}}In Letter on Humanism, Heidegger criticized Sartre''s existentialism:\u000a\u000aExistentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking existentia and essentia according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato''s time on, has said that essentia precedes existentia. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.\u000a\u000aLogical positivists, such as Carnap and Ayer, say Existentialists frequently are confused about the verb "to be" in their analyses of "being".Carnap, Rudolf, Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache [Overcoming Metaphysics by the Logical Analysis of Speech], Erkenntnis (1932), pp.219\u2013241. Carnap''s critique of Heidegger''s "What is Metaphysics". They argue that the verb is transitive, and pre-fixed to a predicate (e.g., an apple is red): without a predicate, the word is meaningless.\u000aInfluence outside philosophy\u000aCultural movement and influenceThe term existentialism was first adopted as a self-reference in the 1940s and 1950s by Jean-Paul Sartre, and the widespread use of literature as a means of disseminating their ideas by Sartre and his associates (notably novelist Albert Camus) meant existentialism "was as much a literary phenomenon as a philosophical one."{{sep entry}} Among existentialist writers were Parisians Jean Genet, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, and playwright Samuel Beckett, the Norwegian Knut Hamsun, and the Romanian friends Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco and Emil Cioran. Prominent artists such as the Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock, Arshile Gorky, and Willem de Kooning have been understood in existentialist terms, as have filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and Ingmar Bergman.\u000aFilm and videoThe French director Jean Genet''s 1950 fantasy-erotic film Un chant d''amour shows two inmates in solitary cells whose only contact is through a hole in their cell wall, who are spied on by the prison warden. Reviewer James Travers calls the film a "...visual poem evoking homosexual desire and existentialist suffering" which "...&nbsp;conveys the bleakness of an existence in a godless universe with painful believability"; he calls it "...&nbsp;probably the most effective fusion of existentialist philosophy and cinema."\u00a9 James Travers 2005 http://72.14.205.104/search?q=cache:iPYJjAhhAuMJ:filmsdefrance.com/FDF_Un_chant_d_amour_rev.htmlStanley Kubrick''s 1957 anti-war film Paths of Glory "illustrates, and even illuminates...existentialism" by examining the "necessary absurdity of the human condition" and the "horror of war".Holt, Jason.

ISBN 0-8131-2445-XOn the lighter side, the British comedy troupe Monty Python have explored existential themes throughout their works, from many of the sketches in their original television show, Monty Python''s Flying Circus, to their 1983 film Monty Python''s The Meaning of Life.{{cite web}} Of the many adjectives (some listed in the introduction above) that might indicate an existential tone, the one utilized the most by the group is that of the absurd.Some contemporary films dealing with existential issues include Fight Club, Waking Life, and Ordinary People{{cite web}}. Likewise, films throughout the 20th century such as The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Taxi Driver, High Noon, Easy Rider, One Flew Over the Cuckoo''s Nest, A Clockwork Orange, Apocalypse Now, Badlands, and Blade Runner also have existential qualities.{{cite web}} Notable directors known for their existentialist films include Ingmar Bergman, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hideaki Anno and Woody Allen.{{cite web}} Charlie Kaufman''s Synecdoche, New York focuses on the protagonist''s desire to find existential meaning in life as he sees its end.{{cite news}}\u000aLiteratureExistentialist perspectives are also found in literature to varying degrees. Jean-Paul Sartre''s 1938 novel Nausea{{Cite document}} was "steeped in Existential ideas", and is considered an accessible way of grasping his philosophical stance.{{Cite book}}  Since 1970, much cultural activity in art, cinema, and literature contains postmodernist and existential elements. Books such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) (now republished as Blade Runner) by Philip K. Dick, Toilet: The Novel by Michael Szymczyk and Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing strong existential themes. Ideas from such thinkers as Dostoevsky, Foucault, Kafka, Nietzsche, Herbert Marcuse, Gilles Deleuze, and Eduard von Hartmann permeate the works of artists such as Chuck Palahniuk, Szymczyk, David Lynch, Crispin Glover, and Charles Bukowski, and one often finds in their works a delicate balance between distastefulness and beauty.\u000aTheatreJean-Paul Sartre wrote No Exit in 1944, an existentialist play originally published in French as Huis Clos (meaning In Camera or "behind closed doors") which is the source of the popular quote, "Hell is other people." (In French, "l''enfer, c''est les autres"). The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively, by probing each other''s sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.Existentialist themes are displayed in the Theatre of the Absurd, notably in Samuel Beckett''s Waiting for Godot, in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot to be an acquaintance but in fact hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, "If I knew, I would have said so in the play."  To occupy themselves they eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, exercise, swap hats, and contemplate suicide\u2014anything "to hold the terrible silence at bay".The Times, 31 December 1964. Quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 57  The play "exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and pathos."Cronin, A., Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), p 391 The play also illustrates an attitude toward man''s experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can only be reconciled in mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in human existence.Tom Stoppard''s Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead is an absurdist tragicomedy first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966.{{cite web}} The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare''s Hamlet. Comparisons have also been drawn to Samuel Beckett''s Waiting For Godot, for the presence of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world that is beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.Jean Anouilh''s Antigone also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas.{{cite web}} It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century B.C. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately "Ante-G\u014cN." The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is "...&nbsp;disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness"; she states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.Critic Martin Esslin in his book Theatre of the Absurd pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Arthur Adamov wove into their plays the existential belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled "Absurdist" (based on Esslin''s book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with ''Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin''s observation.Kernan, Alvin B.

Kierkegaard For Beginners. 1996. Writers And Readers Limited. London, England. p.25 This is evident in his parables, which are a response to a question he is asked. After he tells the parable, he returns the question to the individual.An existential reading of the Bible would demand that the reader recognize that he is an existing subject studying the words more as a recollection of possible events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of "truths" which are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God.Hong, Howard V. "Historical Introduction" to Fear and Trembling. Princeton University Press. Princeton, New Jersey. 1983. p. x Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing them upon him, but as though they are inside him and guiding him from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor''s distance from everyday life-or the learner who should put it to use?"Kierkegaard, Soren. Works of Love. Harper & Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62 From an existential perspective, the Bible would not become an authority in an individual''s life until that individual authorizes the Bible to be such. Existentialism has had a significant influence on theology, notably on postmodern Christianity and on theologians and religious thinkers such as Nikolai Berdyaev, Karl Barth, Paul Tillich, Wilfrid Desan and John Macquarrie.\u000aExistential psychoanalysis and psychotherapy{{Main}}\u000aOne of the major offshoots of existentialism as a philosophy is existential psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of Ludwig Binswanger, a clinician who was influenced by Freud, Edmund Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre. A later figure was Viktor Frankl, who had studied with Freud and Jung as a young man{{Citation needed}}. His logotherapy can be regarded as a form of existential therapy. The existentialists would also influence social psychology, antipositivist micro-sociology, symbolic interactionism, and post-structuralism, with the work of thinkers such as Georg Simmel and Michel Foucault.An early contributor to existential psychology in the United States was Rollo May, who was influenced by Kierkegaard. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existential psychology in the USA is Irvin D. Yalom. Yalom states that\u000aAside from their reaction against Freud''s mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existential analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers - who include Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, Eug\u00e8ne Minkowski, V.E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T. Buytendijk, G. Bally and Victor Frankl - were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May''s highly influential 1985 book Existence - and especially his introductory essay - introduced their work into this country.{{Cite book}} Note: The copyright year has not changed, but the book remains in print.\u000aA more recent contributor to the development of a European version of existential psychotherapy is the British-based Emmy van Deurzen.Anxiety''s importance in existentialism makes it a popular topic in psychotherapy. Therapists often offer existential philosophy as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual''s complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existential approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. Humanistic psychology also had major impetus from existential psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(42,0,'{{Other uses}}\u000a{{More footnotes}}\u000a{{Lead too short}}{{Infobox Philosopher}}Martin Heidegger (September 26, 1889 \u2013 May 26, 1976; {{IPA-de}}) was an influential German philosopher. His best-known book, Being and Time, is considered to be one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century by many professional philosophers.Lackey, Douglas. 1999. "What Are the Modern Classics? The Baruch Poll of Great Philosophy in the Twentieth Century". Philosophical Forum. 30 (4): 329-46 Heidegger remains controversial due to his involvement with Nazism and statements in support of Adolf Hitler.\u000aIntroduction{{Ref improve section}}\u000aHeidegger claimed that Western philosophy has, since Plato, misunderstood what it means for something "to be", tending to approach this question in terms of a being, rather than asking about being itself. In other words, Heidegger believed all investigations of being have historically focused on particular entities and their properties, or have treated being itself as an entity, or substance, with properties. A more authentic analysis of being would, for Heidegger, investigate "that on the basis of which beings are already understood", or that which underlies all particular entities and allows them to show up as entities in the first place.Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, pp. 25\u201326. But since philosophers and scientists have overlooked the more basic, pre-theoretical ways of being from which their theories derive, and since they have incorrectly applied those theories universally, they have confused our understanding of being and human existence. To avoid these deep-rooted misconceptions, Heidegger believed philosophical inquiry must be conducted in a new way, through a process of retracing the steps of the history of philosophy.Heidegger argued that this misunderstanding, beginning with Plato, has left its traces in every stage of Western thought. All that we understand, from the way we speak to our notions of "common sense", is susceptible to error, to fundamental mistakes about the nature of being. These mistakes filter into the terms through which being is articulated in the history of philosophy\u2014such as reality, logic, God, consciousness, and presence. In his later philosophy, Heidegger argues that this profoundly affects the way in which human beings relate to modern technology.Heidegger''s work has strongly influenced philosophy, theology and the humanities. Within philosophy it played a crucial role in the development of existentialism, hermeneutics, deconstruction, postmodernism, and continental philosophy in general. Well-known philosophers such as Karl Jaspers, Leo Strauss, Ahmad Fardid, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas, Hannah Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, and Jacques Derrida have all analyzed Heidegger''s work.Heidegger supported National Socialism and was a member of the Nazi Party from May 1933 until May 1945Source: Hannah Arendt / Martin Heidegger by Elzbieta Ettinger, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1995, page 10. His defenders, notably Hannah Arendt, see this support as arguably a personal " ''error'' " (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger''s Nazi-era politics.)Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger At 80, New York Review of Books, 17/6, (Oct. 21, 1971), 50\u201354; repr. in Heidegger and Modern Philosophy ed. M. Murray  (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978), 293\u2013303 Defenders think this error was largely irrelevant to Heidegger''s philosophy. Critics, such as his former students Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas"Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas\, and the Politics of Dwelling" by David J. Gauthier, Ph.D dissertation, Louisiana State University, 2004, page 156 and Karl L\u00f6with,Karl L\u00f6with, Mein Leben in Deutschland vor und nach 1933: ein Bericht (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1986), p. 57, translated by Paula Wissing as cited by Maurice Blanchot in "Thinking the Apocalypse: a Letter from Maurice Blanchot to Catherine David", in Critical Inquiry 15:2, pp. 476\u2013477. claim that Heidegger''s support for National Socialism revealed flaws inherent in his thought."Emmanuel Faye,[in his \u201cHeidegger: The Introduction of Nazism Into Philosophy,\u201d] argues fascist and racist ideas are so woven into the fabric of Heidegger\u2019s theories that they no longer deserve to be called philosophy. . . . Richard Wolin, the author of several books on Heidegger and a close reader of the Faye book, said he is not convinced Heidegger\u2019s thought is as thoroughly tainted by Nazism as Mr. Faye argues. Nonetheless he recognizes how far Heidegger\u2019s ideas have spilled into the larger culture." An Ethical Question: Does a Nazi Deserve a Place Among Philosophers? by Patricia Cohen. New York Times.

Raised a Roman Catholic, he was the son of the sexton of the village church, Friedrich Heidegger, and his wife Johanna, n\u00e9e Kempf. In their faith, his parents adhered to the First Vatican Council of 1870, which was observed mainly by the poorer class of Me\u00dfkirch. The religious controversy between the wealthy Altkatholiken and the working class led to the temporary use of a converted barn for the Roman Catholics. At the festive reunion of the congregation in 1895, the Old Catholic sexton handed the key to six-year-old Martin.{{Citation needed}}Heidegger''s family could not afford to send him to university, so he entered a Jesuit seminary. He left the seminary within weeks because of a health requirement, and what he described as a psychosomatic heart condition.Hermann Philipse, Heidegger''s Philosophy of Being p. 173, Notes to Chapter One, Martin Heidegger, Supplements, trans. John Van Buren p. 183. Heidegger later left Catholicism, saying it was incompatible with his philosophy. After studying theology at the University of Freiburg from 1909 to 1911, he switched to philosophy, in part again because of his heart condition. Heidegger completed his doctoral thesis on psychologism in 1914 influenced by Neo-Thomism and Neo-Kantianism,Die Lehre vom Urteil im Psychologismus. Ein kritisch-theoretischer Beitrag zur Logik (1914). Source: Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert, "Martin Heidegger", Theologische Realenzyklop\u00e4die, XIV, 1982, p. 562 and in 1916 finished his venia legendi with a thesis on Duns Scotus influenced by Heinrich Rickert and Edmund Husserl.Note, however, that it was discovered later that one of the two main sources used by Heidegger was not by Scotus, but by Thomas of Erfurt. Thus Heidegger''s 1916 doctoral thesis, Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus, should have been entitled, Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die Bedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt. Source: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. In the two years following, he worked first as an unsalaried Privatdozent, then served as a soldier during the final year of World War I, working behind a desk and never leaving Germany. After the war, he served as a salaried senior assistant to Edmund Husserl at the University of Freiburg from 1919 until 1923.\u000aMarburgIn 1923, Heidegger was elected to an extraordinary Professorship in Philosophy at the University of Marburg. His colleagues there included Rudolf Bultmann,  Nicolai Hartmann, and Paul Natorp. Heidegger''s students at Marburg included Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hannah Arendt, Karl L\u00f6with, Gerhard Kr\u00fcger,  Leo Strauss, Jacob Klein, Gunther (Stern) Anders, and Hans Jonas. Through a confrontation with Aristotle he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being. He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete existence, which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as Saint Paul, Augustine of Hippo, Luther, and Kierkegaard. He also read the works of Dilthey, Husserl, and Max Scheler.Gethmann-Siefert, 1982, p. 563\u000aFreiburgIn 1927, Heidegger published his main work Sein und Zeit (Being and Time). When Husserl retired as Professor of Philosophy in 1928, Heidegger accepted Freiburg''s election to be his successor, in spite of a counter-offer by Marburg. Heidegger remained at Freiburg im Breisgau for the rest of his life, declining a number of later offers including one from Humboldt University of Berlin. Among his students at Freiburg were Charles Malik, Herbert Marcuse, and Ernst Nolte. Emmanuel Levinas attended his lecture courses during his stay in Freiburg in 1928.{{Citation needed}}During the 1932 German elections, Heidegger voted for the Nazi Party, which he joined on May 1, 1933 Charles Bambach, Heidegger\u2019s Roots (Cornell University Press, 2003, page 82). He was elected rector of the University on April 21, 1933 with the support of Nazi faculty members and student groups. In his inaugural address as rector on May 27, and in political speeches and articles from the same year, he expressed his support for the Nazi cause and its leader, Adolf Hitler.Julian Young, Heidegger, Philosophy, Nazism (Cambridge University Press, 1997, page 3, page 11). He resigned the rectorate in April 1934, but remained a member of the Nazi party until 1945.Ibid. page 3{{See also}}\u000aPost-warIn late 1946, as France engaged in \u00e9puration l\u00e9gale, the French military authorities determined that Heidegger should be forbidden from teaching or participating in any university activities because of his association with the Nazi Party.Provisional ruling October 5, 1946; final ruling December 28, 1946; Hugo Ott, Martin Heidegger: A Political Life, (Harper Collins, 1993, page 348)  The denazification procedures against Heidegger continued until March 1949, when he was finally pronounced a "Mitl\u00e4ufer" (literally, "fellow-traveler", but the equivalent meaning in English is closer to "bandwagon effect" or "herd instinct", standing for the notion that people often do and believe things merely because many other people do and believe the same things) of National Socialism, and no punitive measures against him were proposed. This opened the way for his readmission to teaching at Freiburg University in the winter semester of 1950\u201351.R\u00fcdiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil (Harvard University Press, 1998, page 373) He was granted emeritus status and then taught regularly from 1951 until 1958, and by invitation until 1967.\u000aPersonal lifeHeidegger married Elfriede Petri on March 21, 1917, in a Catholic ceremony officiated by his friend Engelbert Krebs, and a week later in a Protestant ceremony in the presence of her parents. Their first son J\u00f6rg was born in 1919. According to published correspondence between the spouses,{{citation}} Hermann (born 1920) is the son of Elfriede and Friedel Caesar.Martin Heidegger had extramarital affairs with Hannah Arendt and Elisabeth Blochmann, both students of his. Arendt was Jewish, and Blochmann had one Jewish parent, making them subject to severe persecution by the Nazi authorities. He helped Blochmann emigrate from Germany prior to World War II, and resumed contact with both of them after the war.Martin Heidegger / Elisabeth Blochmann. Briefwechsel 1918\u20131969. Joachim W. Storck, ed. Marbach am Neckar: Deutsches Literatur-Archiv, 1989, 2nd edn. 1990.Heidegger spent much time at his vacation home at Todtnauberg, on the edge of the Black Forest. He considered the seclusion provided by the forest to be the best environment in which to engage in philosophical thought.Being There, a Spring 2007 article on Heidegger''s vacation home for Cabinet magazine.\u000aHeidegger died on May 26, 1976, and was buried in the Me\u00dfkirch cemetery.\u000a\u000aPhilosophy\u000aBeing, time, and Dasein\u000aHeidegger''s philosophy is founded on the attempt to conjoin what he considers two fundamental insights:\u000a\u000aThe first is his observation that, in the course of over 2,000 years of history, philosophy has attended to all the beings that can be found in the world (including the &#34;world&#34; itself), but has forgotten to ask what &#34;being&#34; itself is. This is Heidegger&#39;s &#34;question of being,&#34; and it is Heidegger&#39;s fundamental concern throughout his work. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger&#39;s reading of Franz Brentano''s treatise on Aristotle''s manifold uses of the word &#34;being,&#34; a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, Being and Time, with a citation from Plato''s Sophist For a study on Heidegger''s reading of the Sophist and his less central interest in Plato''s Timaeus and its conception of space qua kh\u00f4ra: see: Nader El-Bizri, "On Kai kh\u00f4ra: Situating Heidegger between the Sophist and the Timaeus", Studia Phaenomenologica, Vol. IV, Issue 1\u20132 (2004), pp. 73\u201398 indicating that Western philosophy has neglected &#34;being&#34; because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question. Heidegger&#39;s intuition about the question of being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the &#34;history of being,&#34; that is, the history of the forgetting of being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive &#34;destruction&#34; of the history of philosophy.\u000aThe second intuition animating Heidegger&#39;s philosophy derives from the influence of Edmund Husserl, a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history. Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, &#34;to the things themselves&#34;). But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is always already situated in a world and in ways of being. Thus Husserl&#39;s understanding that all consciousness is &#34;intentional&#34; (in the sense that it is always intended toward something, and is always &#34;about&#34; something) is transformed in Heidegger&#39;s philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in &#34;care.&#34; This is the basis of Heidegger&#39;s &#34;existential analytic&#34;, as he develops it in Being and Time. Heidegger argues that to describe experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter. Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to &#34;Dasein,&#34; the being for whom being is a question.In everyday German, "Dasein" means "existence." It is composed of "Da" (here/there) and "Sein" (being). Dasein is transformed in Heidegger''s usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is there in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters. In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as Da-sein, thus emphasizing the distance from the word''s ordinary usage. In Being and Time, Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. Dasein, then, is not intended as a way of conducting a &#34;philosophical anthropology,&#34; but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything like a &#34;philosophical anthropology.&#34;Jacques Derrida describes this in the following terms: "We can see then that Dasein, though not man, is nevertheless nothing other than man." Jacques Derrida, "The Ends of Man", Margins of Philosophy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p. 127. Dasein, according to Heidegger, is care. In the course of his existential analytic, Heidegger argues that Dasein, who finds itself thrown into the world amidst things and with others, is thrown into its possibilities, including the possibility and inevitability of one&#39;s own mortality. The need for Dasein to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one&#39;s own existence, is the basis of Heidegger&#39;s notions of authenticity and resoluteness\u2014that is, of those specific possibilities for Dasein which depend on escaping the &#34;vulgar&#34; temporality of calculation and of public life.\u000a\u000aThe marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time. That Dasein is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that Dasein is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of Dasein can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself. For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning. The existential analytic of Being and Time was thus always only a first step in Heidegger''s philosophy, to be followed by the "dismantling" (Destruktion) of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of "limit case" (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity).{{Citation needed}}That Heidegger did not write this second part of Being and Time, and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger''s subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of individual experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the collective human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger''s account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time.Cf. Bernard Stiegler, "Technics of Decision: An Interview", Angelaki 8 (2003), pp. 154\u201367, and cf. the discussion of Stiegler''s reading of Heidegger in the sub-section "Bernard Stiegler" below.\u000aBeing and Time{{Ref improve section}}\u000a\u000a{{Main}}Being and Time (German title: Sein und Zeit), published in 1927, is Heidegger''s first academic book. He had been under pressure to publish in order to qualify for Husserl''s chair at University of Freiburg and the success of this work ensured his appointment to the post.It investigates the question of being by asking about the being for whom being is a question. Heidegger names this being Dasein (see above), and the book pursues its investigation through themes such as mortality, anxiety, temporality, and historicity. It was Heidegger''s original intention to write a second half of the book, consisting of a "Destruktion" of the history of philosophy\u2014that is, the transformation of philosophy by re-tracing its history\u2014but he never completed this project.Being and Time influenced many thinkers, including such existentialist thinkers as Jean-Paul Sartre (although Heidegger distanced himself from existentialism\u2014see below).\u000aDie Kehre\u000aSome scholars have argued that Heidegger''s thought after Being and Time exhibits a "turn" in his thinking (die Kehre). Heidegger denied this in a letter\u2014published by William J. Richardson in Heidegger: Through Phenomenology to Thought (1963)\u2014which stated that, if there had been a turn at all, it was simply a matter of going deeper into the same matters. In his later work, Heidegger largely abandons the account of Dasein as a pragmatic, engaged, worldly agent, and instead discusses other elements necessary to an understanding of being, notably language, the earth (as the almost ineffable foundation of world) and the presence of the gods. Nevertheless, Dasein (or "mortals", as he later prefers to say) remains a crucial part of the coming-about or event (Ereignis) of being.{{Citation needed}}\u000aLater works{{Ref improve section}}\u000a\u000aHeidegger''s later works, following the so-called "turn" and after the Second World War, seem to many commentators to at least reflect a shift of focus, if not indeed a major change in his philosophical outlook. One way this has been understood is as a shift from "doing" to "dwelling", although others feel that this is to overstate the difference. Heidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behavior itself depends on a prior "openness to being." The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness. Heidegger contrasts this openness to the "will to power" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness.Heidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the pre-Socratics, especially Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Anaximander. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with Plato, but a forgetting or abandonment which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.Two recurring themes of Heidegger''s later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of "revealing." Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with modern technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the "material" world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated "standing reserve" (Bestand) of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it. Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as Gestell, or "enframing." Heidegger does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being. Despite this, some commentators have insisted that an agrarian nostalgia permeates his later work.Heidegger''s later works include Vom Wesen der Wahrheit ("On the Essence of Truth", 1930), Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes ("The Origin of the Work of Art", 1935), Einf\u00fchrung in die Metaphysik ("An Introduction to Metaphysics", 1935),  Bauen Wohnen Denken ("Building Dwelling Thinking", 1951), and Die Frage nach der Technik ("The Question Concerning Technology", 1954) and Was heisst Denken? ("What Is Called Thinking?" 1954). Also  Beitr\u00e4ge zur Philosophie (Vom Ereignis) (Contributions to Philosophy [From Enowning]), composed in the years 1936\u201338 but not published until 1989, on the centennial of Heidegger''s birth.\u000aInfluences\u000aAristotle and the GreeksHeidegger was influenced at an early age by Aristotle, mediated through Catholic theology, medieval philosophy, and Franz Brentano. Aristotle''s ethical, logical, and metaphysical works were crucial to the development of his thought in the crucial period of the 1920s. Although he later worked less on Aristotle, Heidegger recommended postponing reading Nietzsche, and to "first study Aristotle for ten to fifteen years."Heidegger, What is Called Thinking? (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), p. 73. In reading Aristotle, Heidegger increasingly contested the traditional Latin translation and scholastic interpretation of his thought. Particularly important (not least for its influence upon others, both in their interpretation of Aristotle and in rehabilitating a neo-Aristotelian "practical philosophy")Kelvin Knight, Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2007). was his radical reinterpretation of Book Six of Aristotle''s Nicomachean Ethics and several books of the Metaphysics. Both informed the argument of Being and Time.The idea of asking about being may be traced back via Aristotle to Parmenides. Heidegger claimed to have revived the question of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the metaphysical tradition extending from Plato to Descartes, a forgetfulness extending to the Age of Enlightenment and then to modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on ancient Greek thought, in particular on Plato, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright Sophocles.{{Citation needed}}\u000aDiltheyHeidegger''s very early project of developing a "hermeneutics of factical life" and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology was influenced in part by his reading of the works of Wilhelm Dilthey.{{Citation needed}}Of the influence of Dilthey, Hans-Georg Gadamer writes the following: "As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in Being and Time that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger''s thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of the influence is much too late." He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt "the clear superiority of Count Yorck over the famous scholar, Dilthey." Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey''s influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger "in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in Being and Time."Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Martin Heidegger''s One Path", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), pp. 22\u20134. Based on Heidegger''s earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey''s thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as "too late", scholars as diverse as Theodore Kisiel and David Farrell Krell have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger''s thought.In The Genesis of Heidegger''s Being and Time (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), Theodor Kisiel designates the first version of the project that culminates in Being and Time, "the Dilthey draft" (p. 313). David Farrell Krell comments in Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1992) that "Heidegger''s project sprouts (in part, but in good part) from the soil of Dilthey''s philosophy of factical-historical life" (p. 35).Even though Gadamer''s interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey''s concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger''s novel ideas about ontology required a gestalt formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.{{Citation needed}}\u000aHusserlThere is disagreement over the degree of influence that Husserl had on Heidegger''s philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger''s philosophy is grounded in phenomenology. These disagreements centre around how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger''s own understanding.On the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: "When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: ''Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger''." Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger''s "rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of Max Scheler''s volcanic fire."Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Martin Heidegger\u201475 Years", Heidegger''s Ways (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 18.Robert J. Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:\u000aHeidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl''s account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger''s approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger''s project in Being and Time or why he let it unfinished.Robert J. Dostal, "Time and Phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger", in Charles Guignon (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 142.\u000aDaniel O. Dahlstrom saw Heidegger''s presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl''s own work. Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:Heidegger''s silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl''s investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a misrepresentation of Husserl''s account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of ''to be'') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its "dangerous closeness" to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl''s account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl''s account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.Daniel O. Dahlstrom, "Heidegger''s Critique of Husserl", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 244.\u000a\u000aKierkegaardHeideggerians regarded S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard as, by far, the greatest philosophical contributor to Heidegger''s own existentialist concepts.Dreyfus, Hubert. Being-in-the-world: A Commentary on Heidegger''s Being and Time, Division I.  (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991), Sec. Appendix. Heidegger''s concepts of anxiety (Angst) and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one''s individual being-in-the-world.\u000aH\u00f6lderlin and Nietzsche{{Ref improve section}}\u000aFriedrich H\u00f6lderlin and Friedrich Nietzsche were both important influences on Heidegger, and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title The Will to Power, rather than on Nietzsche''s published works. Heidegger read The Will to Power as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.This is also the case for the lecture courses devoted to the poetry of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, which became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger''s work and thought. Heidegger grants to H\u00f6lderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be "heard" in Germany or the West. Many of Heidegger''s works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from H\u00f6lderlin''s poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, H\u00f6lderlin''s Hymn "The Ister").\u000aHeidegger and Eastern thought\u000aSome writers on Heidegger''s work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger''s later work, particularly "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue.Heidegger, "A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer", in On the Way to Language (New York: Harper & Row, 1971). Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the Kyoto School, notably Hajime Tanabe and Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d.  It has also been claimed that a number of elements within Heidegger''s thought bear a close parallel to Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly  Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Paul Hsao records Chang Chung-Yuan saying that "Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought."{{Citation needed}}According to Tomonubu Imamichi, the concept of Dasein was inspired\u2014although Heidegger remains silent on this\u2014by Okakura Kakuzo''s concept of das-in-der-Welt-sein (being in the world) expressed in The Book of Tea to describe Zhuangzi''s philosophy, which Imamichi''s teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having studied with him the year before.Tomonubu Imamichi, In Search of Wisdom. One Philosopher''s Journey, Tokyo, International House of Japan, 2004 (quoted by Anne Fagot-Largeau during her lesson at the Coll\u00e8ge de France on December 7, 2006).Some scholars interested in the relationships between Western philosophy and the history of ideas in Islam and Arabic philosophical medieval sources may have been influenced by Heidegger''s work.See for instance: Nader El-Bizri, The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)\u000aHeidegger and National Socialism{{Main}}\u000aThe rectorate\u000a\u000aAdolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933. Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg on April 21, 1933, and assumed the position the following day.  On May 1 he joined the Nazi Party.Heidegger delivered his inaugural address, the Rektoratsrede \u2013 "The University in the New Reich", on May 27, and it became notorious for its praise of National Socialism. Heidegger wrote, for example, that: "The German people must choose its future, and this future is bound to the F\u00fchrer."Source: "German Men and Women!", Freiburger Studentenzeitung,, November 10, 1933, as quoted in //Introducing Heidegger// by Jeff Collins et al., Icon Books, Thriplow, Cambridge, p.e 96His tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties from the outset. Some National Socialist education officials viewed him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. Some of Heidegger''s fellow National Socialists also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation on April 23, 1934, and it was accepted on April 27. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.Philosophical historian Hans Sluga wrote:Though as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to them his sympathy with their activism.Hans Sluga, Heidegger''s Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany (Cambridge, Massachusetts, & London: Harvard University Press, 1993), p. 149.\u000aIn 1945 Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983:The rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans'' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.Heidegger, "The Rectorate 1933/34: Facts and Thoughts", in G\u00fcnther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 29.\u000a\u000aTreatment of Husserl\u000aBeginning in 1917, Jewish-born philosopher Edmund Husserl championed Heidegger''s work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl''s chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg.Seyla Benhabib, The Reluctant Modernism Of Hannah Arendt (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003, p. 120.)On April 6, 1933, the Reichskommissar of Baden Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger''s predecessor as Rector formally notified Husserl of his "enforced leave of absence" on April 14, 1933.Heidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on April 22, 1933. The following week the national Reich law of April 28, 1933, replaced Reichskommissar Wagner''s decree.  The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl''s academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger''s part.Seyla Benhabib, The Personal is not the Political (October/November 1999 issue of Boston Review.)Heidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries.  Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly "settled accounts" with Heidegger and Max Scheler in the early 1930s.Martin Heidegger, "Der Spiegel Interview", in G\u00fcnther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), Martin  Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 48.Heidegger did not attend his former mentor''s cremation in 1938. In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from Being and Time (restored in post-war editions).R\u00fcdiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253\u20138.Heidegger''s behavior towards Husserl has evoked controversy. Hannah Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger''s behavior precipitated Husserl''s death. She called Heidegger a "potential murderer." However, she later recanted her accusation.Elzbieta Ettinger,Hannah Arendt \u2013 Martin Heidegger, (New Haven, Conn., & London: Yale University Press, 1995), p. 37.\u000aPost-rectorate National Socialist period\u000aAfter the spectacular failure of Heidegger''s rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, without canceling his membership in the NSDAP (Nazi Party). Nevertheless, references to National Socialism continued to appear in his work.In the course of his 1935 lectures, Heidegger referred to the "inner truth and greatness of this movement" (die innere Wahrheit und Gr\u00f6\u00dfe dieser Bewegung), that is, of National Socialism. This phrase remained when the lectures were published in 1953 under the title, An Introduction to Metaphysics.  However, Heidegger added a parenthetical qualification, without mentioning this change at the time of publication: "(namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity) (n\u00e4mlich die Begegnung der planetarisch bestimmten Technik und des neuzeitlichen Menschen)."Rainer Marten, letter to J\u00fcrgen Habermas, January 28, 1988, cited by Habermas in "Work and Weltanschauung: the Heidegger Controversy from a German Perspective", Critical Inquiry 15 (1989), pp. 452\u201354.In his lectures of 1942, published posthumously as H\u00f6lderlin''s Hymn "The Ister", Heidegger made the following remark:Today\u2014if one still reads such books at all\u2014one can scarcely read a treatise or book on the Greeks without everywhere being assured that here, with the Greeks, "everything" is "politically" determined. In the majority of "research results", the Greeks appear as the pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such "results" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.Heidegger, H\u00f6lderlin''s Hymn "The Ister" (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1996), pp. 79\u201380.\u000aKarl L\u00f6with met Heidegger in 1936 while the latter was visiting Rome to lecture on H\u00f6lderlin. In an account set down in 1940 and not intended for publication, L\u00f6with recounted an exchange with Heidegger over editorials published in the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung:\u000a[I] told him that I did not agree either with the way in which Karl Barth was attacking him or in the way [Emil] Staiger was defending him, because my opinion was that his taking the side of National Socialism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy. Heidegger told me unreservedly that I was right and developed his idea by saying that his idea of historicity [Geschichtlichkeit] was the foundation for his political involvement.\u000aL\u00f6with continued:In response to my remark that I could understand many things about his attitude, with one exception, which was that he would permit himself to be seated at the same table with a figure such as Julius Streicher (at the German Academy of Law), he was silent at first. At last he uttered this well-known rationalisation (which Karl Barth saw so clearly), which amounted to saying that "it all would have been much worse if some men of knowledge had not been involved." And with a bitter resentment towards people of culture, he concluded his statement: "If these gentlemen had not considered themselves too refined to become involved, things would have been different, but I had to stay in there alone." To my reply that one did not have to be very refined to refuse to work with a Streicher, he answered that it was useless to discuss Streicher; the St\u00fcrmer was nothing more than "pornography." Why didn''t Hitler get rid of this sinister individual? He didn''t understand it.ibid, p. 477\u000a\u000aPost-war period\u000aHeidegger''s affair with Hannah Arendt occurred some time before Heidegger''s involvement in National Socialism, but her friendship with Heidegger did not end when she moved to Heidelberg to continue her studies under Karl Jaspers. Arendt later spoke on his behalf at his denazification hearings. Jaspers spoke against him at the same hearings, suggesting he would have a detrimental influence on German students because of his powerful teaching presence. Arendt cautiously resumed their friendship after the war, despite or even because of the widespread contempt for Heidegger and his political sympathies. The denazification hearings resulted in Heidegger being forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of his disfavour in Germany was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.{{Citation needed}}In a lecture on technology delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger made the following controversial remark:Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.Cited in Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Heidegger, Art and Politics: The Fiction of the Political (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), p. 34.\u000aThis quotation has been the subject of widespread criticism and interpretation. Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, for example, described it as "scandalously inadequate."Lacoue-Labarthe, Heidegger, Art and Politics, p. 34.In 1967 Heidegger had an encounter with the poet Paul Celan, a Jew who had survived concentration camps operated by the Nazis'' Romanian allies. While admiring aspects of Heidegger''s writings, Celan had long been aware of Heidegger''s involvement with National Socialism.{{Citation needed}}On July 24 Celan gave a reading at the University of Freiburg, attended by Heidegger. Heidegger there presented Celan with a copy of What is Called Thinking?, and invited him to visit him at his hut at Todtnauberg, an invitation which Celan accepted. On July 25 Celan visited Heidegger at his retreat, signing the guestbook and spending some time walking and talking with Heidegger. The details of their conversation are not known, but the meeting was the subject of a subsequent poem by Celan, entitled "Todtnauberg" (dated August 1, 1967).{{Citation needed}}The enigmatic poem and the encounter have been discussed by numerous writers on Heidegger and Celan, notably Lacoue-Labarthe. A common interpretation of the poem is that it concerns, in part, Celan''s wish for Heidegger to apologize for Heidegger''s behavior during the Nazi era.{{Citation needed}}\u000aThe Der Spiegel interview\u000aOn September 23, 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff for Der Spiegel magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously (it was published on May 31, 1976). In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with National Socialism in two ways: first, he argued that there was no alternative, saying that he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an "awakening" ("Aufbruch") which might help to find a "new national and social approach", but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives.{{Citation needed}}In his interview Heidegger defended as double-speak his 1935 lecture describing the "inner truth and greatness of this movement." He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by "movement" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no elegy for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to An Introduction to Metaphysics (1953), namely, "the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity."{{Citation needed}}The L\u00f6with account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the Der Spiegel interview in two ways: that there he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The Der Spiegel interviewers did not bring up Heidegger''s 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger''s Nazi sympathies.For critical readings of the interview (published in 1966 as "Only a God Can Save Us", Der Spiegel), see the "Special Feature on Heidegger and Nazism" in Critical Inquiry 15:2 (Winter 1989), particularly the contributions by J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Blanchot. The issue includes partial translations of Derrida''s Of Spirit and Lacoue-Labarthe''s Of Spirit and Heidegger, Art, and Politics: the Fiction of the Political.\u000aInfluence and reception in France\u000aHeidegger was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his ideas have penetrated into many areas, but in France there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting his work.{{Citation needed}}\u000aExistentialism and pre-war influence\u000aHeidegger''s influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when Being and Time, "What is Metaphysics?" and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as Emmanuel Levinas, Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve  and Georges Bataille.On the history of the French translation of Heidegger''s "What is Metaphysics?", and on its importance to the French intellectual scene, cf. Denis Hollier, "Plenty of Nothing", in Hollier (ed.), A New History of French Literature (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 894\u2013900. Because Heidegger''s discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (Dasein, or being-there), his work has often been associated with existentialism. The influence of Heidegger on Sartre''s Being and Nothingness is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the "Letter on ''Humanism''." In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:Sartre''s key proposition about the priority of existentia over essentia  [that is, Sartre''s statement that "existence precedes essence"] does, however, justify using the name "existentialism" as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of "existentialism" has nothing at all in common with the statement from Being and Time [that "the ''essence'' of Dasein lies in its existence"]\u2014apart from the fact that in Being and Time no statement about the relation of essentia and existentia can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory.Heidegger, "Letter on ''Humanism''", Pathmarks (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250\u20131.\u000a"Letter on ''Humanism''" is often seen as a direct response to Sartre''s 1945 lecture "Existentialism is a Humanism."  Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in "Letter on ''Humanism,''" Heidegger asserts that "Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one."  Heidegger''s largest issue with Sartre''s existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic ''move'' in privileging existence over essence, "the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement." From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible.\u000aPost-war forays into France\u000aAfter the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his activities as Rector of Freiburg University. He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at Todtnauberg (see, for example, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard''s brief account in Heidegger and "the jews", which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students). Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with Jean Beaufret, an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun.\u000aDerrida and deconstruction\u000aDeconstruction came to Heidegger''s attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun''s recommendation of Jacques Derrida''s work (Hans-Georg Gadamer was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida''s work came to his attention by way of an assistant). Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work. There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place. Heidegger''s interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun). Braun also brought to Heidegger''s attention the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault''s relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about. (For more on this see Penser \u00e0 Strasbourg, Jacques Derrida, et al., which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, "\u00c0 mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida").Jacques Derrida made emphatic efforts to displace the understanding of Heidegger''s work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of Jean-Paul Sartre and existentialist terms. In Derrida''s view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term "d\u00e9construction" is a term coined to translate Heidegger''s use of the words "Destruktion"\u2014literally "destruction"-and "Abbau"-more literally "de-building"). According to Derrida, Sartre''s interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to Dasein in Being and Time. Because of Derrida''s vehement attempts to "rescue" Heidegger from his existentialist interpreters (and also from Heidegger''s "orthodox" followers), Derrida has at times been represented as a "French Heidegger", to the extent that he, his colleagues, and his former students are made to go proxy for Heidegger''s worst (political) mistakes, despite ample evidence that the reception of Heidegger''s work by later practitioners of deconstruction is anything but doctrinaire.\u000aThe Far\u00edas debate\u000aDerrida, Lacoue-Labarthe, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger''s philosophy and his politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger''s philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida''s work, published as "Les Fins de l''homme \u00e0 partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 ao\u00fbt 1980", Derrida''s "Feu la cendre/cio'' che resta del fuoco", and the studies on Paul Celan by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger''s politics published in and after 1987.When in 1987 V\u00edctor Far\u00edas published his book Heidegger et le nazisme, this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called "deconstructionists" for their association with Heidegger''s philosophy. Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Far\u00edas, on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach. Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: Richard Rorty, for example, declared that "[Farias''] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger''s relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published."Richard Rorty, review of Heidegger and Nazism in the New Republic, quoted on the Temple University Press promotional page for Heidegger and Nazism\u000aBernard Stiegler\u000aMore recently, Heidegger''s thought has considerably influenced the work of the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler''s multi-volume magnum opus, La technique et le temps (volume one translated into English as Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus).Bernard Stiegler, Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), part 2. Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to "originary temporality" other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of Being and Time as an account of psychic individuation, and his later "history of being" as an account of collective individuation. He understands many of the problems of Heidegger''s philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger''s inability to integrate the two.\u000aCriticism\u000aHeidegger''s influence upon 20th century continental philosophy is unquestioned and has produced a variety of critical responses.\u000aEarly criticisms\u000aThe content of Being and Time, according to Husserl, claimed to deal with ontology, but from Husserl''s perspective only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to Dasein. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to "philosophical anthropology" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being.See Edmund Husserl, Psychological and transcendental phenomenology and the confrontation with Heidegger (1927\u20131931) (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1997).The Neo-Kantian Ernst Cassirer and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in Davos in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality. Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in Kant, Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination. Dilthey''s student Georg Misch wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in Lebensphilosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl, Leipzig 1930 (3. ed. Stuttgart 1964).\u000aLeft-Hegelianism and critical theory\u000aHegel-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs and the Frankfurt School, associated the style and content of Heidegger''s thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications.Initially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s. Heidegger''s student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School. Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian-Marxism and Heidegger''s phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger''s thought for its "false concreteness" and "revolutionary conservativism."  Theodor Adorno wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger''s early and later use of language in the Jargon of Authenticity. Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger''s works and influence. In particular, J\u00fcrgen Habermas admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against "postmodernism" in The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity (1985). However, recent work by philosopher and critical theorist Nikolas Kompridis tries to show that Heidegger''s insights into world disclosure are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of renewing that tradition.Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future MIT Press, 2006.Nikolas Kompridis, "Disclosing Possibility: The Past and Future of Critical Theory", International Journal of Philosophical Studies, Volume 13, Issue September 3, 2005 , pages 325 \u2013 351.\u000aReception by Analytic and Anglo-American philosophy\u000aCriticism of Heidegger''s philosophy has also come from analytic philosophy, beginning with logical positivism. Accusing Heidegger of offering an "illusory" ontology, Rudolf Carnap criticized him, in "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" (1932), of committing the fallacy of reification and of wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language, which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing "nonsensical pseudo-propositions."A strong critic of Heidegger''s philosophy was the British logical positivist A. J. Ayer. In Ayer''s view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.Bertrand Russell commented, expressing the sentiments of many mid-20th-century English-speaking philosophers, that:\u000aHighly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.Bertrand Russell, Wisdom of the West (New York: Crescent Books, 1989), p. 303.\u000aRoger Scruton stated that:  "His major work Being and Time is formidably difficult\u2014unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy. I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it".Jeff Collins, Introducing Heidegger (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 7.The analytic tradition values clarity of expression. Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example that "those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can never be confirmed by ''facts,'' i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize ''facts'' never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce their nearness."Martin Heidegger, Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning) (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 307. Apart from the charge of obscurantism, other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger''s work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting.Not all analytic philosophers, however, have been as hostile. Gilbert Ryle wrote a critical yet positive review of Being and Time. Ludwig Wittgenstein made a remark recorded by Friedrich Waismann: "To be sure, I can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety"Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1979, p.68 which has been construed by some commentators{{Who}} as sympathetic to Heidegger''s philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger''s reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part through the efforts of Hubert Dreyfus, Richard Rorty, and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger''s approach to philosophy in the first half of his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein, a significant figure in analytic philosophy. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of itJeff Collins, Introducing Heidegger (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 170..\u000aContemporary European reception\u000aEven though Heidegger is considered by many observers to be the most influential philosopher of the 20th century in continental philosophy, aspects of his work have been criticised by those who nevertheless acknowledge this influence, such as Hans-Georg Gadamer and Jacques Derrida. Some questions raised about Heidegger''s philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger''s supposed neglect of ethics (Emmanuel Levinas), the body (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), or sexual difference (Luce Irigaray).Emmanuel Levinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology. Levinas also condemned Heidegger''s involvement with National Socialism, stating "One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger."Emmanuel Levinas, Nine Talmudic Readings (Indiana University Press, 1990), p. xxv, translated by Annette Aronowicz\u000aCinema\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Ister (2004) is a film based on Heidegger&#39;s 1942 lecture course on Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, and features Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Bernard Stiegler, and Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg.http://www.theister.com/\u000aThe film director Terrence Malick translated Heidegger&#39;s 1929 essay &#34;Vom Wesen des Grundes&#34; into English.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(43,0,'{{External links}}\u000aHermeneutics ({{IPA-en}}) is the study of interpretation theory, and can be either the art of interpretation, or the theory and practice of interpretation. Traditional hermeneutics \u2014 which includes Biblical hermeneutics \u2014 refers to the study of the interpretation of written texts, especially texts in the areas of literature, religion and law. Contemporary, or modern, hermeneutics encompasses not only issues involving the written text, but everything in the interpretative process. This includes verbal and nonverbal forms of communication as well as prior aspects that affect communication, such as presuppositions, preunderstandings, the meaning and philosophy of language, and semiotics.{{Cite book}} Philosophical hermeneutics refers primarily to Hans-Georg Gadamer''s theory of knowledge as developed in Truth and Method, and sometimes to Paul Ricoeur.{{Cite book}} p. 2  Hermeneutic consistency refers to analysis of texts for coherent explanation. A hermeneutic (singular) refers to one particular method or strand of interpretation. See also double hermeneutic.\u000aEtymologyThe folk etymology places the origin (Greek: hermeneutike) with Hermes, the mythological Greek deity whose role is that of messenger of the Gods.Couzen-Hoy, David (1981). The Critical Circle. University of California Press. ISBN 0-520-04639 Besides being mediator between the gods themselves and god and humanity, he leads souls to the underworld upon death, is the inventor of language and speech, interpreter, a liar, thief and trickster.ibid. These multiple roles makes Hermes an ideal representative of Hermeneutics, For, as Socrates notes, words have the power to reveal or conceal, thus promoting the message in an ambiguous way.ibid. The Greek view of language as consisting of signs that could lead to truth or falsehood is the very essence of Hermes, who is said to relish the uneasiness of the messaged. Early use of the word Hermeneutics places it within the boundaries of the sacred.Grondin, Jean (1994). Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics. Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-05969-8.  Pg. 21 The divine message is one only understood on its own terms with uncertainty regarding its truth or falsehood. This ambiguity of message is an irrationality, a sort of madness inflicted upon the receiver. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation\u2014an early hermeneutic\u2014could divine the truth or falsehood (thus the sanity) of a statement.Grondin, Jean (1994). Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics. Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-05969-8.  Pg. 21-22The traditional etymology of Hermeneutics is derived from the Greek word {{polytonic}} (hermeneu\u014d, ''translate'' or ''interpret''), and is of uncertain origin.p.344, Klein It was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of Aristotle''s work \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (Peri Hermeneias, ''On Interpretation'', more commonly referred by its Latin title De Interpretatione). It is one of the earliest (c.360 BC) extant philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit, and formal way.\u000aHistory\u000aAncientIn De Interpretatione Aristotle offers an early understanding that lays the groundwork for many contemporary theories of interpretation and semiotics:{{quote}}Equally important to later developments are texts on poetry, rhetoric, and sophistry, including many of Plato''s dialogues, such as Cratylus, Ion, Gorgias, Lesser Hippias, and Republic, along with Aristotle''s Poetics, Rhetoric, and On Sophistical Refutations.  However, these texts deal more with the presentation and refutation of arguments, speeches and poems rather than the understanding of texts as texts.  As Ramberg and Gjesdal note, "Only with the Stoics, and their reflections on the interpretation of myth, do we encounter something like a methodological awareness of the problems of textual understanding." Some ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Plato, tended to vilify poets and poetry as harmful nonsense\u2014Plato denies entry to poets in his ideal state in The Republic until they can prove their value. In the Ion, Plato famously portrays poets as possessed:{{quote}}The meaning of the poem thus becomes open to ridicule \u2014 whatever hints of the truth it may have, the truth is covered by madness. However, another line of thinking arose with Theagenes of Rhegium, who suggested that instead of taking poetry literally, what was expressed in poems were allegories of nature. Stoic philosophers further developed this idea, reading into the poets not only allegories of natural phenomena, but allegories of ethical behavior.Aristotle differed with his predecessor, Plato, in the worth of poetry.  Both saw art as an act of mimesis, but where Plato saw a pale, essentially false imitation in art of reality, Aristotle saw the possibility of truth in imitation.  As critic David Richter points out, "for Aristotle, artists must disregard incidental facts to search for deeper universal truths"\u2014instead of being essentially false, poetry may be universally true.  (Richter, The Critical Tradition, 57.)  In the Poetics, Aristotle called both the tragedy and the epic noble, with tragedy serving the essential function of purging strong emotions from the audience through katharsis.\u000aBiblical{{main}}\u000aJewish{{main}}{{Eras of the Halakha}}\u000aA common use of the word hermeneutics refers to a process of scriptural interpretation. Its earliest example is however found not in the written texts, but in the Jewish Oral Tradition dated to the Second Temple era (515 BCE - 70 CE) that later became the Talmud.Summaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back at least to Hillel the Elder, although the thirteen principles set forth in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., a fortiori argument (known in Hebrew as \u05e7\u05dc \u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 (kal v''chomer))), to more expansive ones, like the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears (Gezerah Shavah). The rabbis did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.see, e.g., Rambam Hilkhot Talmud Torah 4:8Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differ from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the Tanakh (the Jewish bibilical canon) to be without error.  Any apparent inconsistencies needed to be understood by careful examination of a given text in the context of other texts.  There were different levels of interpretation, some used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some that expounded the law given in the text, and others that found secret or mystical levels of understanding.\u000aChristianThe early Patristic traditions of Biblical exegesis have few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tend toward unification in schools of hermeneutical theory.  The early Christian period of Biblical interpretation can be subdivided into the Apostolic and Sub-apostolic period (which dates from the writing of the New Testament to ca. 200, more commonly known as the age of the Apostolic Fathers who were students of the Apostles, see also Christianity in the 2nd century) and the Antiochine/Alexandrian division (which spans from ca. 200 to the medieval period, divided by historians into the Ante-Nicene Period and First seven Ecumenical Councils).\u000aApostolic and sub-apostolicThe operative hermeneutical principle in the New Testament and earliest Church Fathers was prophecy fulfillment.  The Gospels, particularly the Gospel of Matthew, make extensive use of the Old Testament for the purposes of demonstrating that Jesus was the Messiah.  Examples include Matthew 1:23, 2:15-18, 3:3, 21:42, Mark 1:2-3, 4:12, Luke 3:4-6, 22:37, John 2:17, 12:15, and notably in Luke 4:18-21 and parallels where Jesus read extensively from Isaiah and makes the claim that the prophecy is fulfilled in the crowds hearing it.  The Pauline epistles employ the same principle, as evidenced by 1 Corinthians 1:19 and Ephesians 4:8-10, as does Hebrews (see 8:7-13).The principle is carried over into the sub-apostolic age as well and through the second century.  For example, Irenaeus dedicates an entire chapter in Against Heresies to the defense of Isaiah 7:14, one of the chief prophecies used to validate Jesus as the Messiah.Irenaeus, Against Heresies, III.21, http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xxii.html?scrBook=Jer&scrCh=22&scrV=24#ix.iv.xxii-p34.1, see also as examples II.34 and IV.9 This is consistent with Irenaeus'' general usage.  More so than even he, though, the  second century apologists tended to interpret and utilize most scripture as being primarily for the purpose of showing prophecy fulfillment.  Important among these was Justin Martyr, who made extensive use of scripture to this end.  Examples of this usage may be seen in his Apology in which chapters 31-53 are specifically dedicated to proving Christ through prophecy.  He uses scripture similarly in Dialogue with Trypho.{{quote}}Here Justin demonstrates that prophecy fulfillment supersedes logical context in hermeneutics.  He ignores the christological issues that arise from equating Jesus to the calf idol of Bethel which is the "him" being brought to the king in {{bibleverse}}.It is likely that the high view of prophecy fulfillment is a product of the circumstance of the early church.  The primary goal of early authors was a defense of Christianity against attacks from paganism and Judaism as well as suppressing what were considered schismatic or heretical groups.  To this end, Martin Jan Mulder suggests that prophecy fulfillment was the primary hermeneutical method because Roman society had a high view of both antiquity and oracles.Martin Jan Mulder, ed., Mikra: Text Translation, Reading and Interpretation of the Hebrew Bible in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990), 743.  By using the Old Testament (a term linked with Supersessionism) to validate Jesus, Early Christians sought to tap into both the oracles of the prophets and the antiquity of the Jewish scriptures.\u000aSchools of Alexandria and AntiochBeginning as early as the third century, Christian hermeneutics began to split into two primary schools: Alexandria and Antioch.  The Alexandrian Biblical interpretations stressed allegorical readings, frequently at the expense of the texts'' literal meaning. Primary figures in this school included Origen and Clement of Alexandria.  The Antiochene school stressed instead the more literal and historical meaning of the text.  Theodore of Mopsuestia and Diodore of Tarsus were the primary figures in the Antiochine school.\u000aMedievalMedieval Christian interpretations of text incorporated exegesis into a fourfold mode that emphasized the distinction between the letter and the spirit of the text.This schema was based on the various ways of interpreting the text utilized by the Patristic writers.  The literal sense (sensus historicus) of Scripture denotes what the text states or reports directly. The allegorical sense (sensus allegoricus) explains the text with regard to the doctrinal content of church dogma, so that each literal element has a symbolic meaning, see also Typology (theology).  The moral application of the text to the individual reader or hearer is the third sense, the sensus tropologicus or sensus moralis, while a fourth level of meaning,  the sensus anagogicus, draws out of the text the implicit allusions it contains to secret metaphysical and eschatological knowledge, or gnosis.{{quote}}Hermeneutics in the Middle Ages witnessed the proliferation of non-literal interpretations of the Bible. Christian commentators could read Old Testament narratives simultaneously as prefigurations of analogous New Testament episodes, as symbolic lessons about Church institutions and current teachings, and as personally applicable allegories of the Spirit. In each case, the meaning of the signs was constrained by imputing a particular intention to the Bible, such as teaching morality, but these interpretive bases were posited by the religious tradition rather than suggested by a preliminary reading of the text.The customary medieval exegetical technique commented on the text in glossae ("glosses" or annotations) written between the lines and at the side of the text which was left with wide margins for this very purpose. The text might be further commented on in scholia which are long, exegetical passages, often on a separate page.A similar fourfold categorization is also found in Rabbinic writings. The fourfold categorizations are: Peshat (simple interpretation), Remez (allusion), Derash (interpretive), and Sod (secret/mystical).  It is uncertain whether or not the Rabbinic division of interpretation pre-dates the Patristic version. The medieval period saw the growth of many new categories of Rabbinic interpretation and explanation of the Torah, including the emergence of Kabbalah and the writings of Maimonides.\u000aModernThe discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new humanist education of the 15th century as a historical and critical methodology for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla proved in 1440 that the "Donation of Constantine" was a forgery, through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role explaining the correct analysis of the Bible.However, Biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the Protestant Reformation brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. Luther and Calvin emphasized scriptura sui ipsius interpres. Especially Calvin used brevitas et facilitas as an aspect of theological hermeneutics.The rationalist Enlightenment led hermeneuts, especially Protestant exegetes, to view Scriptural texts as secular Classical texts. Scripture thus was interpreted as responses to historical or social forces, so that apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament, for example, might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporaneous Christian practices.\u000aSchleiermacherFriedrich Schleiermacher (November 21, 1768 \u2013 February 12, 1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts, but to all human texts and modes of communication. The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing the content asserted in terms of the overall organization of the work. He distinguishes between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas, the latter considers the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. Schleiermacher said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding.  He even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding.  He provides a solution to avoidance of misunderstanding: knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws in trying to understand the text and the writer.  There arose in his time a fundamental shift from understanding not only the exact words and their objective meaning to individuality of the speaker or author.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}\u000aDiltheyWilhelm Dilthey{{cite web}} broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to all historical objectifications. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to explore their inner meaning. In his last important essay "The Understanding of Others and Their Manifestations of Life" (1910), Dilthey makes it clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on empathy. Empathy involves a direct identification with the other. Interpretation involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in the work.\u000aDilthey divides the spiritual sciences into 3 structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension. Experience means to feel the situation or thing personally. Dilthey suggests that we can always grasp the meaning of unknown thinking when we try to experience it. Dilthey\u2019s understanding of experience is very similar to Husserl\u2019s. \u000aExpression converts experience into meaning because when we express something it is no more a private and personal thing but an appeal to somebody outside of oneself. Every saying is an expression. Dilthey suggests that we can always return to an expression especially its written form and this practice has the same objective value as an experiment in sciences. The possibility of returning makes scientific analysis possible and therefore humanities maybe labeled as science. Moreover, Dilthey assumes that expression may be \u201csaying\u201d more than the speaker intended because the expression brings forward meanings that the individual conscience may not fully understand. The last structural level of spiritual sciences according to Dilthey is comprehension, which in Dilthey\u2019s context is a dimension which contains both comprehension and incomprehension. Incomprehension means more or less wrong understanding. Dilthey presumes that comprehension produces coexistence: He who understands, understand others; he who does not understand stays alone. According to Gadamer Dilthey thought that we should decode our historical past but he did not think about personal history.\u000a20th Century\u000aHeidegger{{main}}\u000aSince Dilthey, the discipline of hermeneutics has detached itself from this central task and broadened its spectrum to all texts, including multimedia and to understanding the bases of meaning. Reference needed for the multimedia hermeneutics!  In the 20th century, Martin Heidegger''s philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to existential understanding, which was treated more as a direct, non-mediated, thus in a sense more authentic way of being in the world than simply as a way of knowing.Advocates of this approach claim that such texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied using the same scientific methods as the natural sciences, thus use arguments similar to that of antipositivism. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author; thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the social context in which they were formed, but, more significantly, provide the reader with a means to share the experiences of the author. The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the hermeneutic circle.  Among the key thinkers who elaborated this approach is the sociologist Max Weber.\u000aContemporaryHans-Georg Gadamer''s hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserts that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or even mastering our experience. Experience according to Gadamer isn\u2019t fixed but rather changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold what constitutes individual comprehension. Gadamer points out in this context that prejudice is a (nonfixed) reflection of that unfolding comprehension, and is not per se without value. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of understanding. Gadamer points out that we can never step outside of our tradition; all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the hermeneutic circle.Paul Ricoeur developed a hermeneutics based on Heidegger''s concepts, although his own work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.Andr\u00e9s Ort\u00edz-Os\u00e9s has developed his Symbolic Hermeneutics as the Mediterranean response to north European Hermeneutics. His main statement regarding the symbolic understanding of the world is that the meaning is the symbolic healing of the real injury.Bernard Lonergan''s hermeneutics is less well-known, but in a series of masterly articles, Fred Lawrence has outlined a case for considering his work as the culmination and achievement of the postmodern hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger.Frederick G. Lawrence, "Martin Heidegger and the Hermeneutic Revolution," "Hans-Georg Gadamer and the Hermeneutic Revolution," "The Hermeneutic Revolution and Bernard Lonergan: Gadamer and Lonergan on Augustine''s Verbum Cordis - the Heart of Postmodern Hermeneutics," "The Unknown 20th Century Hermeneutic Revolution: Jerusalem and Athens in Lonergan''s Integral Hermeneutics," Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 19/1-2 (2008) 7-30, 31-54, 55-86, 87-118.\u000aCritical theoryJ\u00fcrgen Habermas criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutics, especially Gadamer, because the focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. Habermas also criticized Marxism and previous members of the Frankfurt School for missing the hermeneutical dimension of critical theory. Habermas incorporated the notion of the lifeworld and emphasized the importance of both interaction and communication as well as labor and production for social theory. For Habermas, hermeneutics is one dimension of critical social theory.\u000aApplication\u000aArchaeologyIn archaeology, hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material by analysing possible meanings or social use. Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic as we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them, instead we can only apply modern value in the interpretation. This is most common in stone tools, for example, where using descriptions such as "scraper" can be highly subjective and unproven. Opponents claim that a hermeneutic approach is too relativist and that their own interpretations are based on common-sense evaluation.\u000aArchitectureThough the interpretation of buildings is clearly of abiding interest, there are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw explicitly on the hermeneutics of Heidegger and Gadamer. Of note is the work of Lindsay JonesJones, L. 2000. The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture: Experience, Interpretation, Comparison, p.263;Volume Two: Hermeneutical Calisthenics: A Morphology of Ritual-Architectural Priorities, Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press on the way architecture is received and how that reception changes over time and according to context, i.e. how a building is interpreted by critics, users, historians, etc. Dalibor Vesely situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly-scientific thinking to architecture.Vesely, D. 2004. Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation: The Question of Creativity in the Shadow of Production, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. This tradition fits within a critique of the Enlightenment,Perez-Gomez, A. 1985. Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. but it has also informed design studio teaching. Snodgrass  values historical study and the study of Asian cultures by architects as hermeneutical encounters with otherness Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking, London: Routledge, pp165-180.. He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretationIbid. pp.29-55. With Richard Coyne he extends the argument to a consideration of the nature of architectural education and design as a way of thinking.Snodgrass, A.B., and Coyne, R.D. 1992. "Models, Metaphors and the Hermeneutics of Designing." Design Issues, 9(1): 56-74. The latter also expands to a consideration of the use of computers in design.Coyne, R. 1995. Designing Information Technology in the Postmodern Age: From Method to Metaphor, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.. Alberto Perez-Gomez is also well known for his application of phenomenology and hermeneutics to architectural history.\u000aInternational relationsInsofar as hermeneutics is a cornerstone of both critical theory and constitutive theory, both of which have made important inroads into the postpositivist branch of international relations theory and political science, hermeneutics has been applied to international relations (IR).  Steve Smith refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding a foundationalist yet postpositivist IR theory such as critical theory.  Radical postmodernism is an example of a postpositivist yet anti-foundationalist IR paradigm.\u000aLaw{{main}}\u0009\u0009 \u000aSome scholars argue that law and theology constitute particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition / scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation is central to legal theory at least since the 11th century. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the schools of glossatores, commentatores and usus modernus distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of "laws" (mainly, Justinian''s Corpus Iuris Civilis). The University of Bologna gave birth to a "legal Renaissance" in the 11th century, when the Corpus Iuris Civilis was rediscovered and started to be systematically studied by people like Irnerius and Gratianus. It was an interpretative Renaissance.\u0009 \u000aAfter that, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. Savigny and Betti, among others, made significant contributions also to general hermeneutics. Legal interpretivism, most famously Ronald Dworkin''s, might be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.\u000aPsychology{{See also}}\u000aSimilarly to computer scientists, psychologists have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as alternatives to Cognitivism. Hubert Dreyfus'' critique of conventional artificial intelligence has been influential not only in AI but in psychology, and psychologists are increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation as discussed by philosophers such as Heidegger (cf Embodied cognition) and the later Wittgenstein (cf discursive psychology). Hermeneutics is also influential in Humanistic Psychology {{cite journal}}\u000aReligion and theology{{See also}}\u000aThe process by which theological texts are understood relies on a particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Theorists like Paul Ricoeur have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricoeur''s case, the Bible).\u000aSafety scienceIn the field of Safety Science, especially the study of Human Error, scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches. It has been proposed by the ergonomist Donald Taylor that mechanist models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for conscious human beings.{{cite journal}} Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety taxonomies that make use of hermeneutic concepts, in terms of their categorisation of qualitative data.{{cite journal}}\u000aSociologyIn sociology, hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of social events by analysing their meanings to the human participants and their culture. It enjoyed prominence during the sixties and seventies, and differs from other interpretative schools of sociology in that it  emphasizes the importance of the contextWillis, W. J., & Jost, M. (2007). Foundations of qualitative research; Interpretive and critical approaches. London: Sage. Page 106 as well as the form of any given social behaviour. The central principle of hermeneutics is that it is only possible to grasp the meaning of an action or statement by relating it to the whole discourse or world-view from which it originates: for instance, putting a piece of paper in a box might be considered a meaningless action unless put in the context of democratic elections, and the action of putting a ballot paper in a box. One can frequently find reference to the ''hermeneutic circle'': that is, relating the whole to the part and the part to the whole. Hermeneutics in sociology was most heavily influenced by German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer see Gadamer, Hans-Georg, Truth and Method, 1960.The field of marketing has adopted this term from sociology, using the term to refer to qualitative studies in which interviews with (or other forms of text from) one or a small number of people are closely read, analyzed, and interpreted.\u000aSee also{{col-begin}}\u000a{{col-break}}\u000a\u000aBiblical hermeneutics\u000aBiblical law in Christianity\u000aQura''nic hermeneutics\u000aComputational semiotics\u000aContent analysis\u000aDeconstruction\u000aDiscourse analysis\u000aExegesis\u000aExplanatory model\u000aGymnobiblism\u000aKnowledge representation\u000aLiterary criticism\u000a{{col-break}}\u000a\u000aLiterary theory\u000aMeaning (linguistics)\u000aMeaning (non-linguistic)\u000aMeaning (semiotics)\u000aOpen text\u000aPesher\u000aPhilology\u000aPrinciples of interpretation\u000aSemeiotic\u000aSemiosis\u000aSemiotics\u000a{{col-break}}\u000a\u000aSign\u000aSign relation\u000aSyncretism\u000aTafsir\u000aTalmudical hermeneutics\u000aTheory of mind\u000aTruth\u000aTruth theory\u000aUnderstanding\u000aWesleyan Quadrilateral\u000aEpistemology\u000a{{col-end}}\u000aReferences{{Ibid}}\u000a{{reflist}}\u000a\u000aText of On Interpretation, as translated by E.

Central to much undergraduate education in the United States, it was especially conspicuous in the mid-20th century movement for ''general education''. The decline in liberal education is often attributed to the mobilization that occurred during the Second World War. The premium and emphasis placed upon mathematics, science, and technical training seemingly forced the liberal arts to lose its dominant position in higher educational studies In the early 21st century, many universities and liberal arts colleges have reviewed their curriculums to refresh the liberal education they offer, or to promote broader undergraduate education infused by the spirit of liberal education. This is evident in colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and elsewhere. In Hong Kong, liberal studies is a compulsory subject in senior secondary school. It is sometimes taught in junior secondary as well.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(46,0,'The philosophy of technology is a philosophical field dedicated to studying the nature of technology and its social effects.  \u000aHistory\u000aConsidered under the rubric of the Greek term techne (art, or craft knowledge), the philosophy of technology goes to the very roots of Western philosophy.\u000a\u000aIn his Republic, Plato sees techne as the basis for the philosophers&#39; proper rule in the city.\u000aIn the Nicomachean Ethics (Book 6), Aristotle describes techne as one of the four ways that we can know about the world.\u000aThe Stoics argued that virtue is a kind of techne based upon a proper understanding of the universe. \u000a\u000a\u000a20th century development\u000aTwo of the most prominent 20th century philosophers to directly address the effects of modern technology on humanity were John Dewey and Martin Heidegger. Both saw technology as central to modern life. Although Heidegger was more ambivalent and critical than Dewey. The problem for Heidegger was the hidden nature of technology''s essence, Gestell or Enframing which poised for humans what he called its greatest danger and its greatest possibility.  Heidegger''s major work on technology is found in The Question Concerning Technology.\u000aContemporary philosophy\u000aContemporary philosophers with an interest in technology include Jean Baudrillard, Albert Borgmann, Andrew Feenberg, Langdon Winner, Donna Haraway, Avital Ronell,  Don Ihde, Bruno Latour, Paul Levinson, Carl Mitcham, Leo Marx, Gilbert Simondon, Jacques Ellul and Bernard Stiegler.While a number of important individual works were published in the second half of the twentieth century, Paul Durbin has identified two books published at the turn of the century as marking the development of the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts Techn\u00e9 Vol 7 No 1; these were Technology and the Good Life (2000), edited by Eric Higgs, Andrew Light, and David Strong and American Philosophy of Technology (2001) by Hans Achterhuis.The development that recognised as a three stage  (of Auguste Comte) is considered as a result of development of thinking and accumulation of philosophical achievements, by M. I. Sanduk M. I. Sanduk, Is Philosophy of Technology a Fourth Stage of Comte''s Philosophy development?, http://philpapers.org/profile/8751. For Sanduk, the new development in science applications and sciences obstructions, led to philosophy of technology; so philosophy of technology may be the fourth stage of philosophy. This new philosophy has its logic that can not work without it.\u000aTechnology and neutralityWith improvements in technology comes progress and a great concern over its shadowing effect on society. Leila Green uses recent gun massacres such as ''the Port Arthur Massacre'' and the ''Dunblane Massacre'' to bring out the concepts of technological determinism and social determinism. Technological determinism argues that ''it was features of technology that determined its use and the role of a progressive society was to adapt to [and benefit from]technological change.''[Green, Leila (2001) Technoculture, Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest, p 2.]. The alternative perspective would be social determinism which looks upon society being at fault for the ''development and deployment''[Green, Leila (2001) Technoculture, Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest, p 3] of technologies. The reactions to the gun massacres were different in various regions, Tasmanian authorities made gun laws even stricter than before, while there was a demand in the US for the advocacy of fire arms. And here lies the split, both in opinion and in social dimension. According to Green, a technology can be thought of as a neutral entity only when the soci-cultural context and issues circulating the specific technology are removed, it will be then visible to us that there lies a relationship of social groups and power provided through the possession of technologies.\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aCritique of technology\u000aEthics of technology\u000aHistory of technology\u000aIndustrial sociology\u000aPhilosophy of engineering\u000aTechnological evolution\u000aTheories of technology\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{reflist}}\u000aFurther reading\u000a\u000aJoseph Agassi (1985) Technology: Philosophical and Social Aspects, Episteme, Dordrecht: Kluwer.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(48,0,'Privacy (from Latin privatus ''separated from the rest, deprived of something, esp. office, participation in the government'', from privo ''to deprive'') is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively.  The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share basic common themes. Privacy is sometimes related to anonymity, the wish to remain unnoticed or unidentified in the public realm.  When something is private to a person, it usually means there is something within them that is considered inherently special or personally sensitive. The degree to which private information is exposed therefore depends on how the public will receive this information, which differs between places and over time. Privacy is broader than security and includes the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. The right against unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government, corporations or individuals is part of many countries'' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions. Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy; an example of this would be law concerning taxation, which normally require the sharing of  information about personal income or earnings. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with freedom of speech laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.\u000aPrivacy may be voluntarily sacrificed, normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. Academics who are economists, evolutionary theorists, and research psychologists describe revealing privacy as a ''voluntary sacrifice'', where sweepstakes or competitions are involved. In the business world, a person may give personal details (often for advertising purposes) in order to enter a gamble of winning a prize. Information which is voluntarily shared and is later stolen or misused can lead to identity theft.The concept of privacy is most often associated with Western culture, English and North American in particular. According to some researchers, the concept of privacy sets Anglo-American culture apart even from other Western European cultures such as French or Italian.Gramota.ru The concept is not universal and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. A word "privacy" is sometimes regarded as untranslatableTranslation Today by linguists. Many languages lack a specific word for "privacy". Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combine meaning of \u0443\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 - solitude, \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c - secrecy, and \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c - private life) or borrow English "privacy" (as Indonesian Privasi or Italian la privacy).\u000aTypes of privacyThe term "privacy" means many things in different contexts.  Different people, cultures, and nations have a wide variety of expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an invasion of privacy.\u000aPhysicalPhysical privacy could be defined as preventing "intrusions into one''s physical space or solitude"Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate AmericaBy H. Jeff\u000aThis would include such concerns as:\u000a\u000apreventing intimate acts or one&#39;s body from being seen by others for the purpose of modesty; apart from being dressed this can be achieved by walls, fences, privacy screens, cathedral glass, partitions between urinals, by being far away from others, on a bed by a bed sheet or a blanket, when changing clothes by a towel, etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being heard varies\u000avideo, as aptly named graphics, or intimate acts, behaviors or body part\u000apreventing unwelcome searching of one&#39;s personal possessions\u000apreventing unauthorized access to one&#39;s home or vehicle\u000amedical privacy, the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception\u000a\u000aAn example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy would be the US Fourth Amendment, which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures",Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States | Georgetown Law Journal | Find Articles at BNET.com.  Most countries have laws regarding trespassing and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, or shyness.  There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one has concerns about being the victim of crime or stalking.Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims\u000aInformational{{Main}}\u000aData privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one''s self.  Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise.  In some cases these concerns refer to how data is collected, stored, and associated.  In other cases the issue is who is given access to information.  Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.Various types of personal information often come under privacy concerns. For various reasons, individuals may not wish for personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities to be revealed.  This may be to avoid discrimination, personal embarrassment, or damage to one''s professional reputation.Financial privacy, in which information about a person''s financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of fraud or identity theft.  Information about a person''s purchases can also reveal a great deal about that person''s history, such as places they have visited, whom they have had contact with, products they use, their activities and habits, or medications they have used.Internet privacy is the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over the Internet, and to control who can access that information.  These concerns include whether email can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or whether third parties can track the web sites someone has visited.  Another concern is whether web sites which are visited collect, store, and possibly share personally identifiable information about users. Tools used to protect privacy on the internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like I2P and tor.Medical privacy allows a person to keep their medical records from being revealed to others.  This may be because they have concern that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment.  Or it may be because they would not wish for others to know about medical or psychological conditions or treatment which would be embarrassing.  Revealing medical data could also reveal other details about one''s personal life (such as about one''s sexual activity for example).Sexual privacy prevents a person from being forced to carry a pregnancy to term and enables individuals to acquire and use contraceptives and safe sex supplies and information without community or legal reviewPolitical privacy has been a concern since voting systems emerged in ancient times.  The secret ballot is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political views are not known to anyone other than the original voter \u2014 it is nearly universal in modern democracy, and considered a basic right of citizenship.  In fact even where other rights of privacy do not exist, this type of privacy very often does.\u000aOrganizationalGovernments agencies, corporations, and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals.  Such organizations may implement various security practices in order to prevent this.  Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets.  For example, a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilegeFindLaw''s Writ - Amar: Executive Privilege or declares certain information to be classified, or a corporation might attempt to protect trade secrets.\u000aSpiritual and intellectualThe earliest development of privacy rights began under British common law, which protected "only the physical interference of life and property." Its development from then on became "one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law."Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. Privacy, Information, and Technology, Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9-11  Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a "recognition of man''s spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect." Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic "right to be let alone," and the former definition of "property" would then comprise "every form of possession -- intangible, as well as tangible." By the late 19th century, interest in a "right to privacy" grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.\u000aHistory of privacy{{further}}\u000aPrivacy and technology\u000aAs technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it.  In the case of some technologies, such as the printing press or the Internet, the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached.  It is generally agreed Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.P http://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&sort=relevancerank&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire. and Bermann, S. (2007) that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harvard L.R. 193 (1890), that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.Privacy Law in the United StatesNew technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the U.S. it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana growing operations would be acceptable. However in 2001 in Kyllo v. United States (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy.  As large scale information systems become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no way of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have access to. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to the individual of which the information is about. The concept of information privacy has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear.  Also the consequences of a violation of privacy can be more severe.  Privacy law in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and maintain people''s rights to privacy as they see fit.  But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient.  Proposals such as the APEC Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.\u000aThe right to privacyPrivacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis wrote that privacy is the \u201cright to be let alone\u201d (Warren & Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals.  This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as yellow journalism. Warren and Brandeis declared that information which was previously hidden and private could now be "shouted from the rooftops."Warren and Brandeis, "The Right To Privacy", 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890) Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his Harvard Law Review article in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as saying "the government [was] identified . . . as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katx, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970\u2019s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles.\u000aAn individual rightAlan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes.  Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others".   Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms:\u000aEach individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.\u000a- Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York, U.S.A.: Atheneum.\u000a\u000aUnder liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression.David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops ''data protection'' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information".  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used" Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press..Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any ''defect'' in the ''product'' that is not reported is fraud Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. The American Economic Review, 71(2), 405-409.. For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves" Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books..  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.\u000aA collective value and a human rightThere have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.{{Citation needed}}  Amitai Etzioni suggests a communitarian approach to privacy.  This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81-83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press..  Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others"Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology & Policy, 20, 115-119., and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid).  He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897-905..Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan''s goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection"Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press..Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html  Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society, 28(1), 80-91.\u000aPrivacy protection\u000aFree market versus consumer protection approaches\u000aApproaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.{{cite book}}  In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share.  Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices.  Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is acknowledged that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.  In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person .{{cite paper}} Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.\u000aPrivacy law{{Main}}Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals.  While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries.  For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 12, states:\u000a\u000aNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\u000a\u000aFor Europe, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one''s home and correspondence. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed}} The European Union requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data. It is regulated in the United Kingdom by the Data Protection Act 1998  and in France data protection is also monitored by the CNIL, a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before them being enacted.In the United Kingdom, it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy.  An action may be brought under another tort (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defense that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.Does Beckham judgment change rules?, from BBC News (retrieved 27 April 2005).Concerning privacy laws of the United States, privacy is not guaranteed per se by the Constitution of the United States.  The Supreme Court of the United States has found that other guarantees have "penumbras" that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). In the United States, the right of freedom of speech granted in the First Amendment has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the U.S. by the Privacy Act of 1974, and various state laws.Canadian privacy law is governed federally by multiple acts, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the Privacy Act (Canada).  Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations.  Data privacy was first addressed  with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.In Australia there is the Privacy Act 1988. Privacy sector provisions of the Act apply to private sector organisations with a link to Australia, including:\u000a1. individuals who collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a business. For example, a sole trader''s business activities will be regulated (unless it''s a small business), but information gathered outside business activities won''t be; \u000a2. bodies corporate; and  \u000a3. partnerships, unincorporated associations and trusts - any act or practice of a partner, committee member or trustee is attributed to the organisation. \u000aOrganisations outside Australia must comply with the provisions in some circumstances. Sending information out of Australia is also regulated.http://www.privacy.gov.au/law/actParticularly in EU member states, there are (as explained) comprehensive regulations for data protection. However, Burghardt, Buchmann, B\u00f6hm, K\u00fchling, SivridisA Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009. shows that there is a lack of enfocement of data protection acts, i.e., there exists law but no institution can or feels responsible to controle the parties involved, and to enforce law.\u000aPrivacy on the Internet\u000aThere are many means to protect one''s privacy on the internet.\u000aFor example e-mails can be encryptedEudora 3.05 was released with PGP built in, and then quickly followed by 3.06 without PGP.Eudora Light 3.0.5 and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like I2P and Tor can be used in order to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates.\u000aPrivacy and Location Based Services\u000aAs location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are increasing, problems related to user privacy arise, since user\u2019s position\u000aand preferences constitute personal information and improper use of them violates user\u2019s privacy. Several methods to protect user''s privacy when using location based services have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, in order to be able to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.

Architecture is both the process and product of planning, designing and constructing form, space and ambience that reflect functional, technical, social, and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of material, technology, light and shadow.  Architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realising buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimating and construction administration. As documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, architecture defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or any other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed.Architectural works are often perceived as cultural and political symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.Architecture sometimes refers to the activity of designing any kind of system and the term is common in the information technology world.\u000aThe architect{{Main}}Architects plan, design and review the construction of buildings and structures for the use of people.   Architects also coordinate and integrate engineering design, which has as its primary objective the creative manipulation of materials and forms using mathematical and scientific principles.\u000aTheory of architecture{{Main}}\u000aHistoric treatises\u000aThe earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is De architectura, by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early 1st century CE.D. Rowland - T.N. Howe: Vitruvius. Ten Books on Architecture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1999, ISBN 0-521-00292-3 According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitatis utilitatis venustatis,Translated by Henry Wotton, in 1624, as "firmness, commodity and delight" http://www.gardenvisit.com/landscape/LIH/history/vitruvius.htm#ch1-3Vitruvius which translates roughly as -\u000a\u000aDurability - it should stand up robustly and remain in good condition.\u000aUtility - it should be useful and function well for the people using it.\u000aBeauty - it should delight people and raise their spirits.\u000aAccording to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible.\u000aLeone Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De Re Aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean.\u000aThe most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially; and was based on universal, recognisable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of Vasari.Fran\u00e7oise Choay, Alberti and Vitruvius, editor, Joseph Rykwert, Profile 21, Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5-6 The treatises, by the 18th century, had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish and English.\u000a\u000aIn the early nineteenth century, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin wrote Contrasts (1836) that, as the titled suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world. Gothic architecture, Pugin believed, was the only \u201ctrue Christian form of architecture.\u201dThe 19th century English art critic, John Ruskin, in his Seven Lamps of Architecture, published 1849,John Ruskin, The Seven Lamps of Architecture, G. Allen (1880), reprinted Dover, (1989) ISBN 0-486-26145-X was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the "art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them" contributes "to his mental health, power, and pleasure".For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way "adorned". For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned, functional building needed string courses or rustication, at the very least.On the difference between the ideals of "architecture" and mere "construction", the renowned 20th C. architect Le Corbusier wrote: "You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: This is beautiful. That is Architecture".Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture, Dover Publications(1985). ISBN 0-486-25023-7\u000aContemporary concepts of architectureThe great 19th century architect of skyscrapers, Louis Sullivan, promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: "Form follows function".While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of "function" in place of Vitruvius'' "utility". "Function" came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a building, not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural.Nunzia Rondanini stated, "Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing values, architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.''To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art''s sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality".Rondanini, Nunzia Architecture and Social Change Heresies II, Vol. 3, No. 3, New York, Neresies Collective Inc., 1981.Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are rationalism, empiricism, structuralism, poststructuralism, and phenomenology.In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of sustainability. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management and lighting.\u000aHistory{{Main}}\u000a\u000aOrigins and the ancient worldArchitecture first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, architecture became a craft.Here there is a process of trial and error, and later improvisation or replication of a successful trial. What is termed Vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day.\u000a\u000aEarly human settlements were mostly rural. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of \u00c7atal H\u00f6y\u00fck in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro in the Indian Subcontinent.In many ancient civilizations, like the Egyptians'' and Mesopotamians'', architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the supernatural, while in other ancient cultures such as Persia architecture and urban planning was used to exemplify the power of the state.The architecture and urbanism of the Classical civilizations such as the Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural styles developed.Texts on architecture began to be written in the reinassence period. These became canons to be followed in important works, especially religious architecture. Some examples of canons are found in the writings of Vitruvius, the Kao Gong Ji of ancient China7th-5th centuries BCE. and Vaastu Shastra of ancient India and Manjusri vasthu vidya sastra of Sri Lankahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_ancient_Sri_Lanka .The architecture of different parts of Asia developed along different lines from that of Europe, Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity. In many Asian countries a pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the natural landscape.\u000aThe medieval builder\u000aIslamic architecture began in the 7th century CE, developing from a blend of architectural forms from the ancient Middle East and from Byzantium but also developing features to suit the religious and social needs of the society. Examples can be found throughout the Middle East, North Africa and Spain, and were to become a significant stylistic influence on European architecture during the Medieval period.\u000aIn Europe, in both the Classical and Medieval periods, buildings were not attributed to specific individuals and the names of the architects frequently unknown, despite the vast scale of the many religious buildings extant from this period.During the Medieval period guilds were formed by craftsmen to organize their trade and written contracts have survived, particularly in relation to ecclesiastical buildings. The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, or Magister lathomorum as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents.Over time the complexity of buildings and their types increased. General civil construction such as roads and bridges began to be built. Many new building types such as schools, hospitals, and recreational facilities emerged.\u000aRenaissance and the architect\u000aWith the Renaissance and its emphasis on the individual and humanity rather than religion, and with all its attendant progress and achievements, a new chapter began. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects - Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio - and the cult of the individual had begun.There was still no dividing line between artist, architect and engineer, or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference. At this stage, it was still possible for an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations involved was within the scope of the generalist.\u000aEarly modern and the industrial ageWith the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology, architecture and engineering began to separate, and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects, often at the expense of technical aspects of building design. There was also the rise of the "gentleman architect" who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes, typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the Neo Gothic or Scottish Baronial styles.Formal architectural training in the 19th century, for example at Ecole des Beaux Arts in France, gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility. Effective architects generally received their training in the offices of other architects, graduating to the role from draughtsmen or clerks.Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption. Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products, once within the province of expensive craftsmanship, became cheaper under machine production.Vernacular architecture became increasingly ornamental. House builders could use current architectural design in their work by combining features found in pattern books and architectural journals.\u000aModernism and reaction of architecture{{Main}}\u000aThe dissatisfaction with such a general situation at the turn of the twentieth century gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture. Notable among these is the Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here.Following this lead, the Bauhaus school, founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis\u2014the apex\u2014of art, craft, and technology.When Modern architecture was first practiced, it was an avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order.\u000a\u000aThe approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details. Buildings that displayed their construction and structure, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind traditional forms, were seen as beautiful in their own right.Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York''s World Trade Center.Many architects resisted Modernism, finding it devoid of the decorative richness of ornamented styles. Yet as the founders of that movement lost influence in the late 1970s, Postmodernism developed as a reaction against the austerity of Modernism. Robert Venturi''s contention that a "decorated shed" (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside) was better than a "duck" (a building in which the whole form and its function are tied together) gives an idea of this approach.\u000aArchitecture today{{Main}}\u000aPart of the architectural profession, and also some non-architects, responded to Modernism and Postmodernism by going to what they considered the root of the problem. They felt that architecture was not a personal philosophical or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it had to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to give a livable environment.The Design Methodology Movement involving people such as Christopher Alexander started searching for more people-oriented designs. Extensive studies on areas such as behavioral, environmental, and social sciences were done and started informing the design process.As the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), architecture started becoming more multi-disciplinary. Architecture today usually requires a team of specialist professionals, with the architect being one of many, although usually the team leader.\u000aDuring the last two decades of the twentieth century and into the new millennium, the field of architecture saw the rise of specializations by project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the ''design'' architect {{Ref_label}} from the ''project'' architect.{{Ref_label}}Moving the issues of environmental sustainability into the mainstream is a significant development in the architecture profession. Sustainability in architecture was pioneered in the 1970s by architects such as Ian McHarg in the US and Brenda and Robert Vale in the UK and New Zealand. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques Vernacular Architecture in India. The U.S. Green Building Council''s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.Other energy efficiency and green building rating systems include Energy Star, Green Globes, and CHPS (Collaborative for High Performance Schools).

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(50,0,'{{about}}\u000a{{No footnotes}}\u000a\u000aModernism, in its broadest definition, is modern thought, character, or practice. More specifically, the term describes both a set of cultural tendencies and an array of associated cultural movements, originally arising from wide-scale and far-reaching changes to Western society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The term encompasses the activities and output of those who felt the "traditional" forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, social organization and daily life were becoming outdated in the new economic, social and political conditions of an emerging fully industrialized world.Modernism rejected the lingering certainty of Enlightenment thinking, and also that of the existence of a compassionate, all-powerful Creator.Pericles Lewis, Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel (Cambridge University Press, 2000). pp 38-39."[James] Joyce''s Ulysses is a comedy not divine, ending, like Dante''s, in the vision of a God whose will is our peace, but human all-too-human..."\u000aPeter Faulkner, Modernism (Taylor & Francis, 1990). p 60. This is not to say that all modernists or modernist movements rejected either religion or all aspects of Enlightenment thought, rather that modernism can be viewed as a questioning of the axioms of the previous age.A salient characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness. This often led to experiments with form, and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used (and to the further tendency of abstraction).Gardner, Helen, Horst De la Croix, Richard G. Tansey, and Diane Kirkpatrick. Gardner''s Art Through the Ages (San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1991). ISBN 0155037706. p. 953. The poet Ezra Pound''s paradigmatic injunction was to "Make it new!" Whether or not the "making new" of the modernists constituted a new historical epoch is up for debate.  Philosopher and composer Theodor Adorno warns us:\u000a\u000a\u000a&#34;Modernity is a qualitative, not a chronological, category.  Just as it cannot be reduced to abstract form, with equal necessity it must turn its back on conventional surface coherence, the appearance of harmony, the order corroborated merely by replication.&#34;Adorno, Theodor. Minima Moralia. Verso 2005, p. 218.\u000aAdorno would have us understand modernity as the rejection of the false rationality, harmony, and coherence of Enlightenment thinking, art, and music.  But the past proves sticky. Pound''s general imperative to make new, and Adorno''s exhortation to challenge false coherence and harmony, faces T. S. Eliot''s emphasis on the relation of the artist to tradition. Eliot wrote: \u000a\u000a\u000a&#34;[W]e shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet&#39;s] work, may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.&#34;Tradition and the individual talent" (1919), in Selected Essays. Paperback Edition. (Faber & Faber, 1999).\u000aLiterary scholar Peter Childs sums up the complexity: \u000a\u000a\u000a&#34;There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity and despair.&#34;Childs, Peter. Modernism (Routledge, 2000). ISBN 0415196477. p. 17. Accessed on 2009-02-08.\u000a\u000aThese oppositions are inherent to modernism: it is in its broadest cultural sense the assessment of the past as different to the modern age, the recognition that the world was becoming more complex, and that the old "final authorities" (God, government, science, and reason) were subject to intense critical scrutiny. Current interpretations of modernism vary. Some divide 20th century reaction into modernism and postmodernism, whereas others see them as two aspects of the same movement.\u000aPresent-day perspectives\u000aSome commentators approach Modernism as an overall socially progressive trend of thought, that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve, and reshape their environment, with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge or technology."In the twentieth century, the social processes that bring this maelstrom into being, and keep it in a state of perpetual becoming, have come to be called ''modernization''. These world-historical processes have nourished an amazing variety of visions and ideas that aim to make men and women the subjects as well as the objects of modernization, to give them the power to change the world that is changing them, to make their way through the maelstrom and make it their own. Over the past century, these visions and values have come to be loosely grouped together under the name of ''modernism''" (Berman 1988, 16) From this perspective, Modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was ''holding back'' progress, and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. Others focus on Modernism as an aesthetic introspection. This facilitates consideration of specific reactions to the use of technology in The First World War, and anti-technological and nihilistic aspects of the works of diverse thinkers and artists spanning the period from Nietzsche to Samuel Beckett.Lee Oser, The Ethics of Modernism: Moral ideas in Yeats, Eliot, Joyce, Woolf and Beckett (Cambridge University Press, 2007); F.J. Marker & C.D. Innes, Modernism in European Drama: Ibsen, Stringdberg, Pirandello, Beckett; Morag Shiach, "Situating Samuel Beckett" pp234-247 in The Cambridge Companion to the Modernist Novel, (Cambridge University Press, 2007); Kathryne V. Lindberg, Reading Pound Reading: Modernism After Nietzsche (Oxford University Press, 1987); Pericles Lewis, The Cambridge Introduction to Modernism (Cambridge University Press, 2007). pp21\u000aHistory of Modernism\u000aBeginnings\u000aThe first half of the nineteenth century for Europe was marked by a number of wars and revolutions, which contributed to an aesthetic "turning away" from the realities of political and social fragmentation, and so facilitated a trend towards Romanticism: emphasis on individual subjective experience, the sublime, the supremacy of "Nature" as a subject for art, revolutionary or radical extensions of expression, and individual liberty. By mid-century, however, a synthesis of these ideas with stable governing forms had emerged, partly in reaction to the failed Romantic and democratic Revolutions of 1848. It was exemplified by Otto von Bismarck''s Realpolitik and by "practical" philosophical ideas such as positivism. Called by various names\u2014in Great Britain it is designated the "Victorian era"\u2014this stabilizing synthesis was rooted in the idea that reality dominates over subjective impressions. Central to this synthesis were common assumptions and institutional frames of reference, including the religious norms found in Christianity, scientific norms found in classical physics and doctrines that asserted that the depiction of external reality from an objective standpoint was not only possible but desirable. Cultural critics and historians label this set of doctrines realism, though this term is not universal. In philosophy, the rationalist, materialist and positivist movements established a primacy of reason and system.Against the current ran a series of ideas, some of them direct continuations of Romantic schools of thought. Notable were the agrarian and revivalist movements in plastic arts and poetry (e.g. the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the philosopher John Ruskin). Rationalism also drew responses from the anti-rationalists in philosophy. In particular, Hegel''s dialectic view of civilization and history drew responses from Friedrich Nietzsche and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, who were major influences on existentialism.  All of these separate reactions together began to be seen as offering a challenge to any comfortable ideas of certainty derived by civilization, history, or pure reason. From the 1870s onward, the ideas that history and civilization were inherently progressive and that progress was always good came under increasing attack. Writers Wagner and Ibsen had been reviled for their own critiques of contemporary civilization and for their warnings that accelerating "progress" would lead to the creation of individuals detached from social values and isolated from their fellow men. Arguments arose that the values of the artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form. Philosophers called into question the previous optimism. The work of Schopenhauer was labelled "pessimistic" for its idea of the "negation of the will", an idea that would be both rejected and incorporated by later thinkers such as Nietzsche.Two of the most significant thinkers of the period were, in biology, Charles Darwin, and in political science, Karl Marx. Darwin''s theory of evolution by natural selection undermined the religious certainty of the general public, and the sense of human uniqueness of the intelligentsia. The notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as "lower animals" proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality. Karl Marx argued there were fundamental contradictions within the capitalist system\u2014and that the workers were anything but free. Both thinkers would spawn defenders and schools of thought that would become decisive in establishing modernism.{{Citation needed}}Historians have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. William Everdell has argued that modernism began with Richard Dedekind''s division of the real number line in 1872 and Boltzmann''s statistical thermodynamics in 1874. Clement Greenberg called Immanuel Kant "the first real Modernist",Frascina and Harrison 1982, p. 5. but also wrote, "What can be safely called Modernism emerged in the middle of the last century\u2014and rather locally, in France, with Baudelaire in literature and Manet in painting, and perhaps with Flaubert, too, in prose fiction. (It was a while later, and not so locally, that Modernism appeared in music and architecture)."Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism, seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on 15 June 2006 At first, modernism was called the "avant-garde," and the term remained to describe movements which identify themselves as attempting to overthrow some aspect of tradition or the status quo.Fred Orton and Griselda Pollock, Avant-Gardes and Partisans Reviewed. Manchester University, 1996.Separately, in the arts and letters, two ideas originating in France would have particular impact. The first was impressionism, a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (en plein air). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored Paris Salon, the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the Salon des Refus\u00e9s, created by Emperor Napoleon III to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted tremendous attention, and opened commercial doors to the movement.\u000a\u000aThe second school was symbolism, marked by a belief that language is expressly symbolic in its nature and a portrayal of patriotism, and that poetry and writing should follow connections that the sheer sound and texture of the words create. The poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 would be of particular importance to what would occur afterwards.At the same time social, political, and economic forces were at work that would become the basis to argue for a radically different kind of art and thinking. Chief among these was steam-powered industrialization, which produced buildings that combined art and engineering in new industrial materials such as cast iron to produce railroad bridges and glass-and-iron train sheds\u2014or the Eiffel Tower, which broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be\u2014and at the same time offered a radically different environment in urban life. The miseries of industrial urbanism and the possibilities created by scientific examination of subjects brought changes that would shake a European civilization which had, until then, regarded itself as having a continuous and progressive line of development from the Renaissance. With the telegraph''s harnessing of a new power, offering instant communication at a distance, the experience of time itself was altered.Many modern disciplines (for example, physics, economics, and arts such as ballet and architecture) denote their pre-twentieth century forms as "classical." This distinction indicates the scope of the changes that occurred across a wide range of scientific and cultural pursuits during the period.\u000aTurn of the century\u000aIn the 1890s a strand of thinking began to assert that it was necessary to push aside previous norms entirely, instead of merely revising past knowledge in light of current techniques. The growing movement in art paralleled such developments as the Theory of Relativity in physics; the increasing integration of the internal combustion engine and industrialization; and the increased role of the social sciences in public policy. It was argued that, if the nature of reality itself was in question, and if restrictions which had been in place around human activity were falling, then art, too, would have to radically change. Thus, in the first fifteen years of the twentieth century a series of writers, thinkers, and artists made the break with traditional means of organizing literature, painting, and music.Powerfully influential in this wave of modernity were the theories of Sigmund Freud and Ernst Mach, who argued, beginning in the 1880s, that the mind had a fundamental structure, and that subjective experience was based on the interplay of the parts of the mind. All subjective reality was based, according to Freud''s ideas, on the play of basic drives and instincts, through which the outside world was perceived. Ernst Mach developed a well-known philosophy of science, often called "positivism", according to which the relations of objects in nature were not guaranteed but only known through a sort of mental shorthand. This represented a break with the past, in that previously it was believed that external and absolute reality could impress itself, as it was, on an individual, as, for example, in John Locke''s empiricism, with the mind beginning as a tabula rasa. Freud''s description of subjective states, involving an unconscious mind full of primal impulses and counterbalancing self-imposed restrictions, was combined by Carl Jung with a belief in natural essence to stipulate a collective unconscious that was full of basic typologies that the conscious mind fought or embraced. Darwin''s work had introduced the concept of "man, the animal" to the public mind, and Jung''s view suggested that people''s impulses toward breaking social norms were not the product of childishness or ignorance, but derived from the essential nature of the human animal.{{Citation needed}}Friedrich Nietzsche championed a philosophy in which forces, specifically the ''Will to power'', were more important than facts or things. Similarly, the writings of Henri Bergson championed the vital ''life force'' over static conceptions of reality. All these writers were united by a romantic distrust of Victorian positivism and certainty. Instead they championed, or, in the case of Freud, attempted to explain, irrational thought processes through the lens of rationality and holism. This was connected with the century-long trend to thinking in holistic terms, which would include an increased interest in the occult, and "the vital force".Out of this collision of ideals derived from Romanticism, and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of works, which, while their authors considered them extensions of existing trends in art, broke the implicit contract with the general public that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas. These "modernist" landmarks include the atonal ending of Arnold Schoenberg''s Second String Quartet in 1908, the expressionist paintings of Wassily Kandinsky starting in 1903 and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the Blue Rider group in Munich in 1911, and the rise of fauvism and the inventions of cubism from the studios of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and others in the years between 1900 and 1910. This wave of the modern movement broke with the past in the first decade of the twentieth century, and tried to redefine various artforms in a radical manner. Leading lights within the literary wing of this movement (or, rather, these movements) include:\u000a\u000a\u000aComposers such as Schoenberg, Stravinsky, and George Antheil represent modernism in music. Artists such as Gustav Klimt, Henri Rousseau, Wassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Marcel Duchamp, Giorgio De Chirico, Juan Gris, Piet Mondrian, and the movements Les Fauves,  Cubism, Dada and Surrealism represent various strains of Modernism in the visual arts, while architects and designers such as Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Mies van der Rohe brought Modernist ideas into everyday urban life. Artistic modernism also influenced figures outside the movement; for example, John Maynard Keynes was friends with Woolf and other writers of the Bloomsbury group.\u000aExplosion, 1910\u20131930On the eve of the First World War a growing tension and unease with the social order, seen in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the agitation of "radical" parties, also manifested itself in artistic works in every medium which radically simplified or rejected previous practice. Young painters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse were causing a shock with their rejection of traditional perspective as the means of structuring paintings\u2014a step that none of the impressionists, not even C\u00e9zanne, had taken. In 1907, as Picasso was painting Demoiselles d''Avignon, Oskar Kokoschka was writing M\u00f6rder, Hoffnung der Frauen (Murderer, Hope of Women), the first Expressionist play (produced with scandal in 1909), and Arnold Schoenberg was composing his String Quartet #2 in F-sharp minor, his first composition "without a tonal center." In 1911, Kandinsky painted Bild mit Kreis (Picture With a Circle) which he later called the first abstract painting. In 1913\u2014the year of Edmund Husserl''s Ideas, Niels Bohr''s quantized atom, Ezra Pound''s founding of imagism, the Armory Show in New York, and, in Saint Petersburg, the "first futurist opera," Victory Over the Sun by Alexey Kruchenykh, Velimir Khlebnikov and Kasimir Malevich\u2014another Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, working in Paris for Sergei Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes, composed The Rite of Spring for a ballet, choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky, that depicted human sacrifice. These developments began to give a new meaning to what was termed ''modernism'': It embraced discontinuity, rejecting smooth change in everything from biology to fictional character development and moviemaking. It approved disruption, rejecting or moving beyond simple realism in literature and art, and rejecting or dramatically altering tonality in music. This set modernists apart from 19th century artists, who had tended to believe not only in smooth change (''evolutionary'' rather than ''revolutionary'') but also in the progressiveness of such change\u2014''progress.'' Writers like Dickens and Tolstoy, painters like Turner, and musicians like Brahms were not ''radicals'' or ''Bohemians,'' but were instead valued members of society who produced art that added to society, even sometimes while critiquing its less desirable aspects. Modernism, while still "progressive," increasingly saw traditional forms and traditional social arrangements as hindering progress, and therefore recast the artist as a revolutionary, overthrowing rather than enlightening. Futurism exemplifies this trend. In 1909, the Parisian newspaper Le Figaro published F.T. Marinetti''s first manifesto. Soon afterward a group of painters (Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr\u00e0, Luigi Russolo, and Gino Severini) co-signed the Futurist Manifesto. Modeled on the famous "Communist Manifesto" of the previous century, such manifestoes put forward ideas that were meant to provoke and to gather followers. Strongly influenced by Bergson and Nietzsche, Futurism was part of the general trend of Modernist rationalization of disruption.Modernist philosophy and art were still viewed as only a part of the larger social movement. Artists such as Klimt and C\u00e9zanne, and composers such as Mahler and Richard Strauss were "the terrible moderns"&mdash;those farther to the avant-garde were more heard of than heard. Polemics in favour of geometric or purely abstract painting were largely confined to ''little magazines'' (like The New Age in the UK) with tiny circulations. Modernist primitivism and pessimism were controversial, but were not seen as representative of the Edwardian mainstream, which was more inclined towards a Victorian faith in progress and liberal optimism. \u000a\u000aHowever, the Great War and its subsequent events were the cataclysmic upheavals that late 19th century artists such as Brahms had worried about, and avant-gardists had embraced. First, the failure of the previous status quo seemed self-evident to a generation that had seen millions die fighting over scraps of earth\u2014prior to the war, it had been argued that no one would fight such a war, since the cost was too high. Second, the birth of a machine age changed the conditions of life&mdash;machine warfare became a touchstone of the ultimate reality. Finally, the immensely traumatic nature of the experience dashed basic assumptions: realism seemed bankrupt when faced with the fundamentally fantastic nature of trench warfare, as exemplified by books such as Erich Maria Remarque''s All Quiet on the Western Front. Moreover, the view that mankind was making slow and steady moral progress came to seem ridiculous in the face of the senseless slaughter. The First World War fused the harshly mechanical geometric rationality of technology with the nightmarish irrationality of myth.\u000a\u000aThus modernism, which had been a minority taste before the war, came to define the 1920s. It appeared in Europe in such critical movements as Dada and then in constructive movements such as surrealism, as well as in smaller movements such as the Bloomsbury Group. Each of these "modernisms," as some observers labelled them at the time, stressed new methods to produce new results. Again, impressionism was a precursor: breaking with the idea of national schools, artists and writers adopted ideas of international movements. Surrealism, cubism, Bauhaus, and Leninism are all examples of movements that rapidly found adopters far beyond their geographic origins.Exhibitions, theatre, cinema, books and buildings all served to cement in the public view the perception that the world was changing. Hostile reaction often followed, as paintings were spat upon, riots organized at the opening of works, and political figures denounced modernism as unwholesome and immoral. At the same time, the 1920s were known as the "Jazz Age," and the public showed considerable enthusiasm for cars, air travel, the telephone and other technological advances.By 1930, modernism had won a place in the establishment, including the political and artistic establishment, although by this time modernism itself had changed. There was a general reaction in the 1920s against the pre-1918 modernism, which emphasized its continuity with a past while rebelling against it, and against the aspects of that period which seemed excessively mannered, irrational, and emotionalistic. The post-World War period, at first, veered either to systematization or nihilism and had, as perhaps its most paradigmatic movement, Dada. While some writers attacked the madness of the new modernism, others described it as soulless and mechanistic. Among modernists there were disputes about the importance of the public, the relationship of art to audience, and the role of art in society. Modernism comprised a series of sometimes contradictory responses to the situation as it was understood, and the attempt to wrestle universal principles from it. In the end science and scientific rationality, often taking models from the 18th-century Enlightenment, came to be seen as the source of logic and stability, while the basic primitive sexual and unconscious drives, along with the seemingly counter-intuitive workings of the new machine age, were taken as the basic emotional substance. From these two seemingly incompatible poles, modernists began to fashion a complete weltanschauung that could encompass every aspect of life.\u000aSecond generation, 1930\u20131945\u000aBy 1930, Modernism had entered popular culture. With the increasing urbanization of populations, it was beginning to be looked to as the source for ideas to deal with the challenges of the day. As modernism gained traction in academia, it was developing a self-conscious theory of its own importance. Popular culture, which was not derived from high culture but instead from its own realities (particularly mass production) fueled much modernist innovation. By 1930 The New Yorker magazine began publishing new and modern ideas by young writers and humorists like Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, E.B. White, S.J. Perelman, and James Thurber, amongst others. Modern ideas in art appeared in commercials and logos, the famous London Underground logo, designed by Edward Johnston in 1919, being an early example of the need for clear, easily recognizable and memorable visual symbols. Another strong influence at this time was Marxism. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalist aspect of pre-World War I Modernism, which for many modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions, and the neoclassicism of the 1920s, as represented most famously by T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky&mdash;which rejected popular solutions to modern problems&mdash;the rise of Fascism, the Great Depression, and the march to war helped to radicalise a generation. The Russian Revolution catalyzed the fusion of political radicalism and utopianism, with more expressly political stances. Bertolt Brecht, W. H. Auden, Andr\u00e9 Breton, Louis Aragon and the philosophers Antonio Gramsci and Walter Benjamin are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this modernist Marxism. This move to the radical left, however, was neither universal, nor definitional, and there is no particular reason to associate modernism, fundamentally, with ''the left''. Modernists explicitly of ''the right'' include Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Wyndham Lewis, William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, the Dutch author Menno ter Braak and many others.\u000aOne of the most visible changes of this period was the adoption of objects of modern production into daily life. Electricity, the telephone, the automobile\u2014and the need to work with them, repair them and live with them\u2014created the need for new forms of manners and social life. The kind of disruptive moment that only a few knew in the 1880s became a common occurrence. For example, the speed of communication reserved for the stock brokers of 1890 became part of family life. Modernism as leading to social organization would produce inquiries into sex and the basic bondings of the nuclear, rather than extended, family. The Freudian tensions of infantile sexuality and the raising of children became more intense, because people had fewer children, and therefore a more specific relationship with each child: the theoretical, again, became the practical and even popular.\u000aModernism after World War II (The visual and performing arts)\u000aIn Britain and America, modernism as a literary movement is generally considered to be relevant up to the early 1930s, and "modernist" is rarely used to describe authors prominent after 1945. This is somewhat true for all areas of culture, with the exception of the visual and performing arts.The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris (the former center of European culture and the former capital of the art world) the climate for art was a disaster. Important collectors, dealers, and modernist artists, writers, and poets had fled Europe for New York and America. The surrealists and modern artists from every cultural center of Europe had fled the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn''t flee perished. A few artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard, remained in France and survived. The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, surrealism, Joan Mir\u00f3, cubism, Fauvism, and early modernism via great teachers in America like Hans Hofmann and John D. Graham. American artists benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Max Ernst and the Andr\u00e9 Breton group, Pierre Matisse''s gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim''s gallery The Art of This Century, as well as other factors.\u000aPollock and abstract influences\u000aDuring the late 1940s Jackson Pollock''s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso''s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art gets made. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock''s process\u2014placing unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and non-imagery\u2014essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art. \u000a\u000aThe other abstract expressionists followed Pollock''s breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. Rereadings into abstract art by art historians such as Linda Nochlin,Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: Women Artists at the Millennium (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006. Griselda Pollock Pollock, Griselda, Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive. Routledge, 2007. and Catherine de Zegher De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), 3 X Abstraction. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005. critically show, however, that pioneering women artists who produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by official accounts of its history.\u000aIn the 1960s after abstract expressionism{{Main}}\u000aIn abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism. Clement Greenberg became the voice of post-painterly abstraction when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. Color field painting, hard-edge painting and lyrical abstractionAldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November-December 1969, pp.104-113. emerged as radical new directions.By the late 1960s however, postminimalism, process art and Arte PoveraMovers and Shakers, New York, "Leaving C&M", by Sarah Douglas, Art+Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7. also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements that encompassed both painting and sculpture, via lyrical abstraction and the postminimalist movement, and in early conceptual art. Process art as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, and plastic and real space. Nancy Graves, Ronald Davis, Howard Hodgkin, Larry Poons, Jannis Kounellis, Brice Marden, Bruce Nauman, Richard Tuttle, Alan Saret, Walter Darby Bannard, Lynda Benglis, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, Sam Gilliam, Mario Merz and Peter Reginato were some of the younger artists who emerged during the era of late modernism that spawned the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It''s Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp.3,55-63.\u000aPop art{{Main}}\u000a\u000aIn 1962 the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists, the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the New York School and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in England in 1958 the term "Pop Art" was used by Lawrence Alloway to describe paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age. The early works of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi were considered seminal examples in the movement. Meanwhile in the downtown scene in New York''s East Village 10th Street galleries artists were formulating an American version of pop art. Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show the works of Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. Later Leo Castelli exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for most of their careers. There is a connection between the radical works of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction.\u000aMinimalism{{Main}}By the early 1960s minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in geometric abstraction of Kazimir Malevich, the Bauhaus and Piet Mondrian) that rejected the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of abstract expressionist surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of action painting. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Associated with painters such as Frank Stella, minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Minimalism is variously construed either as a precursor to postmodernism, or as a postmodern movement itself. In the latter perspective, early minimalism yielded advanced modernist works, but the movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists like Robert Morris changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.\u000aPostminimalism\u000aIn the late 1960s Robert Pincus-Witten coined the term postminimalism to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected. The term was applied by Pincus-Whitten to the work of Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra and new work by former minimalists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, and Sol LeWitt, and Barry Le Va, and others. Other minimalists including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, Agnes Martin, John McCracken and others continued to produce late modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainders of their careers.In the 1960s the work of the avant-garde minimalist composers La Monte Young, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley also achieved prominence in the New York art world.Since then, many artists have embraced minimal or postminimal styles and the label "postmodern" has been attached to them.\u000aCollage, assemblage, installations{{Main}}\u000a\u000aRelated to abstract expressionism was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of Robert Rauschenberg exemplifies this trend. His "combines" of the 1950s were forerunners of pop art and installation art, and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs. Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art. Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials. Another pioneer of collage was Joseph Cornell, whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of found objects.\u000aNeo-Dada{{Main}}In the early 20th century Marcel Duchamp exhibited a urinal as a sculpture. His professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as "readymades." Fountain was a urinal signed with the pseudonym R. Mutt, the exhibition of which shocked the art world in 1917. This and Duchamp''s other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being John Cage''s 4''33", which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg''s Erased de Kooning. Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualites of the work itself. Thus, because Fountain was exhibited, it was a sculpture.Marcel Duchamp famously gave up "art" in favor of chess. Avant-garde composer David Tudor created a piece, Reunion (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, that features a chess game in which each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. Duchamp and Cage played the game at the work''s premier.Another trend in art associated with neo-Dada is the use of a number of different media together. Intermedia, a term coined by Dick Higgins and meant to convey new artforms along the lines of Fluxus, concrete poetry, found objects, performance art, and computer art. Higgins was publisher of the Something Else Press, a concrete poet, husband of artist Alison Knowles and an admirer of Marcel Duchamp.\u000aPerformance and happenings{{Main}}\u000a\u000aDuring the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. Yves Klein in France, and in New York City, Carolee Schneemann, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman and Yoko Ono were pioneers of performance-based works of art. Groups like The Living Theater with Julian Beck and Judith Malina collaborated with sculptors and painters creating environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer especially in their piece Paradise Now. The Judson Dance Theater, located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York; and the Judson dancers, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others; collaborated with artists Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and engineers like Billy Kl\u00fcver. Park Place Gallery was a center for musical performances by electronic composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass and other notable performance artists including Joan Jonas. These performances were intended as works of a new art form combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. They were characterized by the reductive philosophies of minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressivity of abstract expressionism.During the same period, various avant-garde artists created Happenings. Happenings were mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in various specified locations, often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physicality, costuming, spontaneous nudity, and various random or seemingly disconnected acts. Notable creators of happenings included Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Robert Whitman.\u000aFluxus{{Main}}Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931\u201378), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to John Cage''s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage''s students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mac Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins.Fluxus encouraged a do-it-yourself aesthetic and valued simplicity over complexity. Like Dada before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.\u000aLate period{{Main}}\u000a\u000aArtists from many disciplines continue to work in modernist styles into the 21st century. The continuation of abstract expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstraction, geometric abstraction, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, postminimalism, and other late 20th century modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continue through the first decade of the 21st century.At the turn of the 21st century, well-established artists such as Sir Anthony Caro, Lucian Freud, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Agnes Martin, Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, Helen Frankenthaler, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, James Rosenquist, Alex Katz, Philip Pearlstein, and younger artists including Brice Marden, Chuck Close, Sam Gilliam, Isaac Witkin, Sean Scully, Joseph Nechvatal, Elizabeth Murray, Larry Poons, Richard Serra, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Ronald Davis, Dan Christensen, Joel Shapiro, Tom Otterness, Joan Snyder, Ross Bleckner, Archie Rand, Susan Crile, and dozens of others continued to produce vital and influential paintings and sculpture. However, by the early 1980s the postmodern movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various conceptual and intermedia formats. Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold even earlier, some say by the 1950s. While postmodernism implies an end to modernism, many theorists and scholars contend that late modernism continues into the 21st century.\u000aGoals of the movement\u000aMany modernists believed that by rejecting tradition they could discover radically new ways of making art. Arnold Schoenberg rejected traditional tonal harmony, the hierarchical system of organizing works of music that had guided music making for at least a century and a half. He believed he had discovered a wholly new way of organizing sound, based in the use of twelve-note rows. Abstract artists, taking as their examples the impressionists, as well as Paul C\u00e9zanne and Edvard Munch, began with the assumption that color and shape, not the depiction of the natural world, formed the essential characteristics of art. Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Kazimir Malevich all believed in redefining art as the arrangement of pure color. The use of photography, which had rendered much of the representational function of visual art obsolete, strongly affected this aspect of modernism. However, these artists also believed that by rejecting the depiction of material objects they helped art move from a materialist to a spiritualist phase of development.\u000a\u000a{{Main}}\u000aOther modernists, especially those involved in design, had more pragmatic views. Modernist architects and designers believed that new technology rendered old styles of building obsolete. Le Corbusier thought that buildings should function as "machines for living in", analogous to cars, which he saw as machines for traveling in. Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from Ancient Greece or from the Middle Ages. In some cases form superseded function. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms. The skyscraper, such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe''s Seagram Building in New York (1956&ndash;1958), became the archetypal modernist building. Modernist design of houses and furniture also typically emphasized simplicity and clarity of form, open-plan interiors, and the absence of clutter. Modernism reversed the 19th-century relationship of public and private: in the 19th century, public buildings were horizontally expansive for a variety of technical reasons, and private buildings emphasized verticality&mdash;to fit more private space on increasingly limited land. Conversely, in the 20th century, public buildings became vertically oriented and private buildings became organized horizontally. Many aspects of modernist design still persist within the mainstream of contemporary architecture today, though its previous dogmatism has given way to a more playful use of decoration, historical quotation, and spatial drama.\u000a\u000aIn other arts such pragmatic considerations were less important. In literature and visual art some modernists sought to defy expectations mainly in order to make their art more vivid, or to force the audience to take the trouble to question their own preconceptions. This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to consumer culture, which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century. Whereas most manufacturers try to make products that will be marketable by appealing to preferences and prejudices, high modernists rejected such consumerist attitudes in order to undermine conventional thinking. The art critic Clement Greenberg expounded this theory of modernism in his essay Avant-Garde and Kitsch.Clement Greenberg, Art and Culture, Beacon Press, 1961 Greenberg labelled the products of consumer culture "kitsch", because their design aimed simply to have maximum appeal, with any difficult features removed. For Greenberg, modernism thus formed a reaction against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial popular music, Hollywood, and advertising. Greenberg associated this with the revolutionary rejection of capitalism.Some modernists did see themselves as part of a revolutionary culture&mdash;one that included political revolution. Others rejected conventional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of political consciousness had greater importance than a change in political structures. Many modernists saw themselves as apolitical. Others, such as T. S. Eliot, rejected mass popular culture from a conservative position. Some  even argue that modernism in literature and art functioned to sustain an elite culture which excluded the majority of the population.\u000aCriticisms of modernism\u000aThe most controversial aspect of the modern movement was, and remains, its rejection of tradition. Modernism''s stress on freedom of expression, experimentation, radicalism, and primitivism disregards conventional expectations. In many art forms this often meant startling and alienating audiences with bizarre and unpredictable effects, as in the strange and disturbing combinations of motifs in surrealism or the use of extreme dissonance and atonality in modernist music. In literature this often involved the rejection of intelligible plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that defied clear interpretation.After the rise of Stalin, the Soviet Communist government rejected modernism on the grounds of alleged elitism, although it had previously endorsed futurism and constructivism. The Nazi government of Germany deemed modernism narcissistic and nonsensical, as well as "Jewish" and "Negro" (see Anti-semitism). The Nazis exhibited modernist paintings alongside works by the mentally ill in an exhibition entitled Degenerate Art. Accusations of "formalism" could lead to the end of a career, or worse. For this reason many modernists of the post-war generation felt that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism, the "canary in the coal mine," whose repression by a government or other group with supposed authority represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened. Louis A. Sass compared madness, specifically schizophrenia, and modernism in a less fascist manner by noting their shared disjunctive narratives, surreal images, and incoherence.Sass, Louis A. (1992). Madness and Modernism: Insanity in the Light of Modern Art, Literature, and Thought. New York: Basic Books. Cited in Bauer, Amy (2004). "Cognition, Constraints, and Conceptual Blends in Modernist Music", in The Pleasure of Modernist Music. ISBN 1-58046-143-3.In fact, modernism flourished mainly in consumer/capitalist societies, despite the fact that its proponents often rejected consumerism itself. However, high modernism began to merge with consumer culture after World War II, especially during the 1960s. In Britain, a youth sub-culture emerged calling itself "modernist" (usually shortened to Mod), following such representative music groups as The Who and The Kinks. The likes of Bob Dylan, Serge Gainsbourg and The Rolling Stones combined popular musical traditions with modernist verse, adopting literary devices derived from James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, James Thurber, T. S. Eliot, Guillaume Apollinaire, Allen Ginsberg, and others. The Beatles developed along similar lines, creating various modernist musical effects on several albums, while musicians such as Frank Zappa, Syd Barrett and Captain Beefheart proved even more experimental. Modernist devices also started to appear in popular cinema, and later on in music videos. Modernist design also began to enter the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space age high-tech future.This merging of consumer and high versions of modernist culture led to a radical transformation of the meaning of "modernism". First, it implied that a movement based on the rejection of tradition had become a tradition of its own. Second, it demonstrated that the distinction between elite modernist and mass consumerist culture had lost its precision. Some writers{{Who}} declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now "post avant-garde", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement. Many have interpreted this transformation as the beginning of the phase that became known as postmodernism. For others, such as art critic Robert Hughes, postmodernism represents an extension of modernism."Anti-modern" or "counter-modern" movements seek to emphasize holism, connection and spirituality as remedies or antidotes to modernism. Such movements see modernism as reductionist, and therefore subject to an inability to see systemic and emergent effects. Many modernists came to this viewpoint, for example Paul Hindemith in his late turn towards mysticism. Writers such as Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, in The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World (2000), Fredrick Turner in A Culture of Hope and Lester Brown in Plan B, have articulated a critique of the basic idea of modernism itself &mdash; that individual creative expression should conform to the realities of technology. Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable. In some fields the effects of modernism have remained stronger and more persistent than in others. Visual art has made the most complete break with its past. Most major capital cities have museums devoted to ''Modern Art'' as distinct from post-Renaissance art (circa 1400 to circa 1900). Examples include the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. These galleries make no distinction between modernist and postmodernist phases, seeing both as developments within ''Modern Art''.\u000aDifferences between modernism and postmodernism\u000aModernism is an encompassing label for a wide variety of cultural movements. Postmodernism is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on socio-political theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th Century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.Askoxford.comMerriam-Webster''s definition of postmodernismRuth Reichl, Cook''s November 1989; American Heritage Dictionary''s definition of the postmodernPostmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonise modernism "after the fact" is doomed to undisambiguable contradictions.Postmodernism. Georgetown universityIn a narrower sense, what was modernist was not necessarily also postmodern.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(51,0,'\u000aEnvironmentalism is a broad philosophy and social movement regarding concerns for environmental conservation and improvement of the state of the environment. Environmentalism and environmental concerns are often represented by the color green.{{cite web}}\u000aEnvironmentalism as a social movement\u000aEnvironmentalism can also be defined as a social movement that seeks to influence the political process by lobbying, activism, and education in order to protect natural resources and ecosystems. In recognition of humanity as a participant in ecosystems, the environmental movement is centered on ecology, health, and human rights.An environmentalist is a person who may speak out about our natural environment and the sustainable management of its resources through changes in public policy or individual behavior by supporting practices such as not being wasteful. In various ways (for example, grassroots activism and protests), environmentalists and environmental organizations seek to give the natural world a stronger voice in human affairs.\u000aHistory{{Main}}\u000a{{Disputed-section}}\u000aA concern for environmental protection has recurred in diverse forms, in different parts of the world, throughout history. For example, in the Middle East, the earliest known writings concerned with environmental pollution were Arabic medical treatises written during the "Arab Agricultural Revolution", by writers such as Alkindus, Costa ben Luca, Rhazes, Ibn Al-Jazzar, al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Avicenna, Ali ibn Ridwan, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Abd-el-latif, and Ibn al-Nafis. They were concerned with air contamination, water contamination, soil contamination, solid waste mishandling, and environmental assessments of certain localities.{{cite journal}}Science and Islam by Ehsan Masood In Europe, King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke had become a problem.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} The fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow. Air pollution would continue to be a problem in England, especially later during the Industrial Revolution, and extending into the recent past with the Great Smog of 1952.\u000aOrigins of the modern environmental movementIn Europe, the Industrial Revolution gave rise to modern environmental pollution as it is generally understood today. The emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal and other fossil fuels gave rise to unprecedented air pollution and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste.{{cite web}} The first large-scale, modern environmental laws came in the form of the British Alkali Acts, passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution (gaseous hydrochloric acid) given off by the Leblanc process, used to produce soda ash. Environmentalism grew out of the amenity movement, which was a reaction to industrialization, the growth of cities, and worsening air and water pollution.In Victorian Britain, an early "Back-to-Nature" movement that anticipated modern environmentalism was advocated by intellectuals\u000asuch as John Ruskin, William Morris and Edward Carpenter, who were all against consumerism, pollution and other activities that were harmful to the natural world.Gould, Peter C. (1988). Early Green Politics, Brighton,Harvester Press, pgs. 15-19, and\u000aWall, Derek, (1994) Green History: A Reader. London,Routledge, pgs. 9-14. \u000aTheir ideas also inspired various proto-environmental groups in the UK, such as the Commons Preservation Society, the Kyrle Society, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Garden city movement, as well as encouraging the \u000aSocialist League and The Clarion movement to advocate \u000ameasures of nature conservation. \u000aGould,(1988) pgs. 16, 23-4,36-8,84-6. In the United States, the beginnings of an environmental movement can be traced as far back as 1739, though it was not called environmentalism and was still considered conservation until the 1950s. Benjamin Franklin and other Philadelphia residents, citing "public rights," petitioned the Pennsylvania Assembly to stop waste dumping and remove tanneries from Philadelphia''s commercial district. The US movement expanded in the 1800s, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples'' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book Walden, which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature''s inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in Yosemite Valley and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form Yosemite National Park and went on to set up the Sierra Club. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.In the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the American Bison. The death of the last Passenger Pigeon as well as the endangerment of the American Bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and popularize their concerns. In 1916 the National Park Service was founded by US President Woodrow Wilson.In 1949, A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold was published. It explained Leopold\u2019s belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organizations. David Brower, Ansel Adams and Nancy Newhall created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. "This Is Dinosaur" edited by Wallace Stegner with photographs by Martin Litton and Philip Hyde prevented the building of dams within Dinosaur National Monument by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of Yosemite National Park, when photographs convinced Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanized public opposition to building dams in the Grand Canyon and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the Wilderness Society and many others. After a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population control, and curbing the exploitation of natural resources. In 1962 Silent Spring by American biologist Rachel Carson was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of DDT in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on ecology or human health. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds.{{cite book}}{{pn}} The resulting public concern led to the creation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in disease vector control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book''s legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth.In the 1970s, the Chipko movement was formed in India; influenced by Mohandas Gandhi, they set up peaceful resistance to deforestation by literally hugging trees (leading to the term "tree huggers"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan "ecology is permanent economy" were very influential.By the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The Back-to-the-land movement started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with anti-Vietnam War sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as deep ecology. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 and the formation of CITES in 1975.In 1979, James Lovelock, a former NASA scientist, published Gaia: A new look at life on Earth, which put forth the Gaia Hypothesis; it proposes that life on Earth can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the Deep Green ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists.Environmentalism has also changed to deal with new issues such as global warming and genetic engineering.\u000aEnvironmental movement{{Main}}The environmental movement (a term that sometimes includes the conservation and green movements) is a diverse scientific, social, and political movement. In general terms, environmentalists advocate the sustainable management of resources, and the protection (and restoration, when necessary) of the natural environment through changes in public policy and individual behavior. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in ecosystems, the movement is centered around ecology, health, and human rights. Though the movement is represented by a range of organizations, because of the inclusion of environmentalism in the classroom curriculum,{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite web}} the environmental movement has a younger demographic than is common in other social movements (see green seniors). Environmentalism as a movement covers broad areas of institutional oppression. Examples of these oppressions are: consumption of ecosystems and natural resources into waste, dumping waste into disadvantaged communities, air pollution, water pollution, weak infrastructure, exposure of organic life to toxins, monoculture, and various other focuses. Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: Environmental Science, Environmental Activism, Environmental Advocacy, and Environmental Justice.\u000aFree market environmentalism{{Main}}Free market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the free market, property rights, and tort law provide the best tools to preserve the health and sustainability of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and class action.\u000aPreservation and conservationEnvironmental preservation in the United States is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, only to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation.{{cite book}} Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources.\u000aEnvironmental organizations and conferences{{Main}}Environmental organizations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private (NGO). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.There are some volunteer organizations. For example Ecoworld, which is about the environment and is based in team work and volunteer work. Some US environmental organizations, among them the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, specialize in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based National Wildlife Federation, the Nature Conservancy, and The Wilderness Society, and global groups like the World Wide Fund for Nature and Friends of the Earth, disseminate information, participate in public hearings, lobby, stage demonstrations, and may purchase land for preservation. Smaller groups, including Wildlife Conservation International, conduct research on endangered species and ecosystems. More radical organizations, such as Greenpeace, Earth First!, and the Earth Liberation Front, have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground Earth Liberation Front engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.On an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a UN conference in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and the follow-up United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. Other international organizations in support of environmental policies development include the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (NAFTA), the European Environment Agency (EEA), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\u000a\u000aSee also{{Portal box}}\u000a\u000aConservation ethic\u000aConservation movement\u000aEcology movement\u000aEcotropism\u000aEnvironmentalism in film and television\u000aEnvironmental movement\u000aEnvironmentalism in music\u000aFree-market environmentalism\u000aList of environment topics\u000aPositive environmentalism\u000aStewardship (theology)\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading\u000a\u000a\u000a{{cite web}}\u000a{{cite web}}\u000a{{cite web}}\u000ade Steiguer, J.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(52,0,'Fernand Braudel (August 24, 1902 \u2013 November 27, 1985) was the foremost French historian of the postwar era and a leader of the Annales School.  His scholarship focused on three great projects, each representing several decades of intense study: "The Mediterranean" (1923\u201349, then 1949\u201366), "Civilization and Capitalism" (1955\u201379), and the unfinished "Identity of France" (1970\u201385). His reputation stems in part from his writings, but even more from his success in making the Annales School the most important engine of historical research in France and much of the world after 1950. As the dominant leader of the Annales School of historiography in the 1950s and 1960s, he exerted enormous influence on historical writing in France and other countries.Braudel has been considered one of the greatest of those modern historians who have emphasised the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors in the making and telling of history.i.e. Fernand Braudel, "The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II" (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1996) He can also be considered as one of the precursors of World Systems Theory.\u000aLifeBraudel was born in Lum\u00e9ville-en-Ornois (as of 1973, merged with and part of Gondrecourt-le-Ch\u00e2teau), in the d\u00e9partement of the Meuse, France, where he also lived with his paternal grandmother for a long time. His father, who was a natural mathematician, aided him in his studies.  Braudel also studied a good deal of Latin and a little Greek.  He loved history and wrote poetry.  Braudel wanted to be a doctor, but his father opposed this idea. At the age of 20, he became an agr\u00e9g\u00e9 in history. While teaching at a secondary school in Algeria, 1923\u201332, he became fascinated by the Mediterranean Sea and everything about it. From 1932 to 1935 he taught in the Paris lyc\u00e9es of Pasteur, Condorcet, and Henry IV.\u000aHe met Lucien Febvre, the co-founder of the influential Annales journal, who was to have a great influence on his work. By 1900, the French solidified their cultural influence in Brazil through the establishment of the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts. S\u00e3o Paulo still lacked a university, however, and in 1934 francophile Julio de Mesquita Filho invited anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Braudel to help establish one. The result was formation of the new University of S\u00e3o Paulo.  Braudel later said that the time in Brazil was the "greatest period of his life."Thomas E. Skidmore, "Levi-Strauss, Braudel and Brazil: a Case of Mutual Influence." Bulletin of Latin American Research 2003 22(3): 340\u2013349. Issn: 0261-3050 Fulltext: Ebsco Braudel returned to Paris in 1937. He had already started archival research on his doctorate on the Mediterranean when he fell under the influence of the Annales School around 1938. Also around this time he entered the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes as an instructor in history. He worked with Lucien Febvre, who would later read the early versions of Braudel''s magnum opus and provide him with editorial advice. At the outbreak of war in 1939, he was called up and subsequently taken prisoner in 1940 by the Germans. While a prisoner of war in a camp near L\u00fcbeck in Germany, Braudel drafted his great work La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en a l''\u00e9poque de Philippe II (The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II), without access to his books or notes but relying on his prodigious memory.Braudel became the leader of the second generation of Annales historians after 1945. In 1947, with Febvre and Charles Moraz\u00e9, Braudel obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York founded the famous Sixi\u00e8me Section for "Economic and social sciences" at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes..He received an additional $1 million from the Ford Foundation in 1960.

Issn: 0147-9032 In 1962 he and Gaston Berger used the Ford Foundation grant and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l''Homme (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death.  It was housed in the building called "Maison des Sciences de l''Homme". FMSH focused its activities on international networking in order to disseminate the Annales approach to Europe and the world.  After a sort of "palace coup" in 1968 he had to share power, and in 1972 he gave up all editorial responsibility on the journal, although his name remained on the masthead.In 1962, he wrote A History of Civilizations as the basis for a history course, but its rejection of the traditional event-based narrative was too radical for the French ministry of education, which in turn rejected it Richard Mayne, "Translator''s Introduction" in Fernand Braudel, "A History of Civilization," (New York:  Penguin Books, 1993), pp. xxvi\u2013xxvii.A feature of Braudel''s work was his compassion for the suffering of marginal people.Fernand Braudel, A History of Civilizations, translated by Richard Mayne (New York:  Penguin Books, 1993). He articulated the obvious: that most surviving historical sources come from the wealthy (or at least literate) classes \u2014 those who are either rich or aspire to be. He emphasized the importance of the ephemeral lives of slaves, serfs, peasants, and the urban poor, demonstrating their contributions to the wealth and power of their respective masters and societies. Indeed, he appeared to think that these people form the real material of civilization. His work was often illustrated with contemporary depictions of daily life, rarely with pictures of noblemen or kings.In 1949 Braudel had been elected to the Coll\u00e8ge de France upon Febvre\u2019s retirement. He himself retired in 1968. In 1983, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.\u000aLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9eHis first book, La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en \u00e0 l''Epoque de Philippe II (1949) (The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II) was his most influential.  The Mediterranean legacy in Europe included cultivated crops and its associated consumption habits; monotheistic religion; urbanism; the language, laws, and pretensions of the state as mental and cultural tools; the prestige of the written word; and the instruments of chronology. The Mediterranean culture ceased to be dominant in the 15th or 16th century, but the new Atlantic culture absorbed much of it and transmitted its elements to Siberia, the Americas, and Australasia.{{Citation needed}}For Braudel there is no single Mediterranean Sea. There are many seas\u2014indeed a "vast, complex expanse" within which men operate. Life is conducted on the Mediterranean: people travel, fish, fight wars, and drown in its various contexts. And the sea articulates with the plains and islands. Life on the plains is diverse and complex; the poorer south is affected by religious diversity (Catholicism and Islam), as well as by intrusions \u2013 both cultural and economic \u2013 from the wealthier north. In other words, the Mediterranean cannot be understood independently from what is exterior to it. Any rigid adherence to boundaries falsifies the situation. The first level of time, geographical time, is that of the environment, with its slow, almost imperceptible change, its repetition and cycles. Such change may be slow, but it is irresistible. The second level of time comprises social and cultural history, with social groupings, empires and civilizations. Change at this level is much more rapid than that of the environment; Braudel looks at two or three centuries in order to spot a particular pattern, such as the rise and fall of various aristocracies. The third level of time is that of events (histoire \u00e9v\u00e9nementielle). This is the history of individuals with names. This, for Braudel, is the time of surfaces and deceptive effects. It is the time of the "courte dur\u00e9e" proper and it is the focus of Part 3 of The Mediterranean which treats of "events, politics and people."  Braudel''s Mediterranean is a nexus of seas, but just as important, it is also the desert and the mountains. The desert creates a nomadic form of social organization where the whole community moves; mountain life is sedentary. Transhumance is also a factor\u2014that is, the movement from the mountain to the plain, or vice versa in a given season. Braudel''s vast, panoramic view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the longue dur\u00e9e, and downplayed the importance of specific events. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.\u000aCapitalism\u000aAfter La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, Baudel''s most famous work is the three-volume Civilisation Mat\u00e9rielle, Economie et Capitalisme, XVe-XVIIIe (Capitalism and Material Life, 1400-1800), which first appeared in 1979. [Note: Braudel published the first volume of Civilization and Capitalism in 1967, and it was translated as Capitalism and Material Life, 1400\u20131800 in 1973.]Review Essay by Alan Heston, Department of Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Fernand Braudel''s Civilization and Capitalism,EH.net,http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/heston The entire three-volume work is a broad-scale history of the preindustrial modern world, presented in the minute detail demanded by the school called cliometrics, focusing on how people made economies work.  Like all his major works, it mixed traditional economic material with a thick description of the social impact of economic events on various facets of everyday life such as food, fashion, and social customs.  There was little original research in the survey; rather, it was a synthesis of a large body of work by many scholars, some of it outdated. Braudel compiled descriptive detail rather than building theoretical constructs. He avoided all economic theory, and used statistical data as an illustrative rather than an analytic tool.  Braudel claimed that there are long-term cycles in the capitalist economy which developed in Europe in the 12th century. Particular cities, and later nation-states, follow each other sequentially as centers of these cycles: Venice and Genoa in 13th through 15th centuries (1250\u20131510), Antwerp in 16th century (1500\u20131569), Amsterdam in 16th through 18th centuries (1570\u20131733), and London (and England) in 18th and 19th centuries (1733\u20131896). He used the word "structures" to denote a variety of organized behaviours, attitudes, and conventions, as well as literal structures and infrastructures. He argued that structures that were built up in Europe during the Middle Ages contributed to the successes of present-day European-based cultures. He attributed much of this to the long-standing independence of city-states, which, though later subjugated by larger geographic states, were not always completely suppressed\u2014probably for reasons of utility.Braudel argued that capitalists have typically been monopolists and not, as is usually assumed, entrepreneurs operating in competitive markets.  He argued that capitalists did not specialize and did not use free markets. He thus diverged from both liberal (Adam Smith) and Marxian interpretations. In Braudel''s view, under capitalism the state has served as a guarantor of monopolists rather than as the protector of competition usually portrayed. He asserted that capitalists have had power and cunning on their side as they have arrayed themselves against the majority of the population.{{Citation}}.\u000aHistoriography\u000aAccording to Braudel, prior to the Annales approach, the writing of history was focused on the courte dur\u00e9e (short span), or on histoire \u00e9v\u00e9nementielle (a history of events). Political and diplomatic history is a prime example of histoire \u00e9v\u00e9nementielle, which he criticized as too limited.  His followers admired his use of the longue dur\u00e9e approach to stress the slow and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.See Wallerstein, "Time and Duration" (1997) The Annales historians, after living through two world wars and massive political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue dur\u00e9e, arguing that the continuities in the deepest structures of society were central to history. Upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history, they argued, lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions.Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." History Workshop Journal (2004) (57): 161\u2013174. Issn: 1363-3554 Fulltext: OUP A proponent of historical materialism, Braudel rejected Marxist materialism, stressing the equal importance of infrastructure and superstructure, both of which reflected enduring social, economic, and cultural realities.  Braudel''s structures, both mental and environmental, determine the long-term course of events by constraining actions on, and by, humans over a duration long enough that they are beyond the consciousness of the actors involved.\u000aRecognitionSUNY Binghamton in New York has a Fernand Braudel Center, and there is an Instituto Fernand Braudel de Economia Mundial in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\u000aWorks\u000a\u000aLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en a l''\u00e9poque de Philippe II 3 vols.

(1999) Africa, Twenty-First Century Books. ISBN 0-7613-1367-2. With a billion people (as of 2009, see table) in 61 territories, it accounts for about 14.72% of the World''s human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent has 54 states, including Madagascar, various island groups, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, a member state of the African Union whose statehood is disputed by Morocco.Africa, particularly central eastern Africa, is widely regarded within the scientific community to be the origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), as evidenced by the discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later ones that have been dated to around seven million years ago \u2013 including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster \u2013 with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to ca. 200,000 years ago.Homo sapiens: University of Utah News Release: Feb. 16, 2005{{Dead link}}Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.{{cite web}}\u000aEtymologyAfri was the name of several peoples who dwelt in North Africa near Carthage. Their name is usually connected with Phoenician afar, "dust", but a 1981 theoryNames of countries, Decret and Fantar, 1981 has asserted that it stems from a Berber word ifri or Ifran meaning "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.The Berbers, by Geo.

The Roman suffix "-ca" denotes "country or land".{{cite web}} The later Muslim kingdom of Ifriqiya, modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.Other etymological theories that have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":\u000a\u000athe 1st century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (Ant. 1.15) asserted that it was named for Epher, grandson of Abraham according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.\u000aLatin word aprica (&#34;sunny&#34;) mentioned by Isidore of Seville in Etymologiae XIV.5.2.\u000athe Greek word aphrike (\u0391\u03c6\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae), meaning &#34;without cold.&#34; This was proposed by historian Leo Africanus (1488\u20131554), who suggested the Greek word phrike (\u03c6\u03c1\u03af\u03ba\u03b7, meaning &#34;cold and horror&#34;), combined with the privative prefix "a-", thus indicating a land free of cold and horror.\u000aMassey, in 1881, derived an etymology from the Egyptian af-rui-ka, &#34;to turn toward the opening of the Ka.&#34; The Ka is the energetic double of every person and &#34;opening of the Ka&#34; refers to a womb or birthplace.

Africa shared the supercontinent''s relatively uniform fauna which was dominated by theropods, prosauropods and primitive ornithischians by the close of the Triassic period. Late Triassic fossils are found through-out Africa, but are more common in the south than north. The boundary separating the Triassic and Jurassic marks the advent of an extinction event with global impact, although African strata from this time period have not been thoroughly studied.Jacobs, Louis L. (1997). "African Dinosaurs." Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. Edited by Phillip J. Currie and Kevin Padian. Academic Press. pp. 2\u20134.Early Jurassic strata are distributed in a similar fashion to Late Triassic beds, with more common outcrops in the south and less common fossil beds which are predominated by tracks to the north. As the Jurassic proceeded, larger and more iconic groups of dinosaurs like sauropods and ornithopods proliferated in Africa. Middle Jurassic strata are neither well represented nor well studied in Africa. Late Jurassic strata are also poorly represented apart from the spectacular Tendaguru fauna in Tanzania. The Late Jurassic life of Tendaguru is very similar to that found in western North America''s Morrison Formation.Midway through the Mesozoic, about 150\u2013160 million years ago, Madagascar separated from Africa, although it remained connected to India and the rest of the Gondwanan landmasses. Fossils from Madagascar include abelisaurs and titanosaurs.  Later into the Early Cretaceous epoch, the India-Madagascar landmass separated from the rest of Gondwana. By the Late Cretaceous, Madagascar and India had permanently split ways and continued until later reaching their modern configurations.By contrast to Madagascar, mainland Africa was relatively stable in position through-out the Mesozoic. Despite the stable position, major changes occurred to its relation to other landmasses as the remains of Pangea continued to break apart. By the beginning of the Late Cretaceous epoch South America had split off from Africa, completing the southern half of the Atlantic Ocean. This event had a profound effect on global climate by altering ocean currents.During the Cretaceous, Africa was populated by allosauroids and spinosaurids, including the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs. Titanosaurs were significant herbivores in its ancient ecosystems. Cretaceous sites are more common than Jurassic ones, but are often unable to be dated radiometrically making it difficult to know their exact ages.

However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the Second Cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and Eastern Africa. Since this time dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa, and increasingly during the last 200 years, in Ethiopia.The domestication of cattle in Africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gathering cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC cattle were already domesticated in North Africa.Diamond, Jared. (1999) "Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York:Norton, pp.167.

Roman settlement occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. Christianity spread across these areas from Palestine via Egypt, also passing south, beyond the borders of the Roman world into Nubia and by at least the 6th century into Ethiopia.In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic Caliphate expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Ummayad capital Damascus fell in the eight century, the Islamic center of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to Qayrawan in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists and philosophers. During the above mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.{{cite book}}\u000a9th\u201318th century\u000aPre-colonial Africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities{{cite news}} characterised by many different sorts of political organisation and rule. These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the San people of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the Bantu-speaking people of central and southern Africa, heavily structured clan groups in the Horn of Africa, the large Sahelian kingdoms, and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the Yoruba and Igbo people (also misspelled as Ibo) in West Africa, and the Swahili coastal trading towns of East Africa.By the 9th century AD a string of dynastic states, including the earliest Hausa states, stretched across the sub-saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were Ghana, Gao, and the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Ghana declined in the 11th century but was succeeded by the Mali Empire which consolidated much of western Sudan in the 13th century. Kanem accepted Islam in the 11th century.In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew up with little influence from the Muslim north. The Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo was established around the 9th century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest Kingdom in modern day Nigeria and was ruled by the Eze Nri.

LovejoyIn West Africa, the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the New World, increasing anti-slavery legislation in Europe and America, and the British Royal Navy''s increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies.

Egypt and Sudan were never incorporated into any European colonial empire, however, after the British occupation of 1882, the country was effectively under British administration until 1922. Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence.Independence movements in Africa gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, Libya, a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, Tunisia and Morocco won their independence from France. Ghana followed suit the next year, becoming the first of the sub-Saharan colonies to be freed. Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade, most often through relatively peaceful means, though in some countries, notably Algeria, it came only after a violent struggle. Portugal''s overseas presence in Sub-Saharan Africa (most notably in Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Guinea and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the Estado Novo regime was overthrown in a military coup in Lisbon. Zimbabwe won its independence from the United Kingdom in 1980 after a bitter guerrilla war between black nationalists and the white minority Rhodesian government of Ian Smith. Although South Africa was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country''s white minority through a system of racial segregation known as apartheid until 1994.\u000aPost-colonial AfricaToday, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which still have the borders drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships. A number of Africa''s post-colonial political leaders were military generals who were poorly educated and ignorant on matters of governance. Great instability, however, was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund, also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by funding insurgency movements. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist/Soviet policies made the situation worse.{{cite news}}Robert G.

A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer Ptolemy (85\u2013165 AD), indicating Alexandria along the Prime Meridian and making the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.Geologically, Africa includes the Arabian Peninsula; the Zagros Mountains of Iran and the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey mark where the African Plate collided with Eurasia. The Afrotropic ecozone and the Saharo-Arabian desert to its north unite the region biogeographically, and the Afro-Asiatic language family unites the north linguistically.\u000aClimateThe climate of Africa ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks.

In July 2004, the African Union''s Pan-African Parliament (PAP) was relocated to Midrand, in South Africa, but the African Commission on Human and Peoples'' Rights remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation''s institutions so that they are shared by all the states.The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, which aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP.\u000a1\u000aThe powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the Protocol of the Pan African Parliament, as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the OAU Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.There are clear signs of increased networking among African organisations and states. In the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighbouring African countries became involved (see also Second Congo War). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent''s many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war.

The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are an Austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce, By Naomi Schwarz, voanews.com, July 10\u000aLanguages{{Main}}\u000aBy most estimates, well over a thousand languages (UNESCO has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.{{cite web}} Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major language families indigenous to Africa.\u000a\u000aThe Afro-Asiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the Horn of Africa, North Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.\u000aThe Nilo-Saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by Nilotic tribes in Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Uganda, and northern Tanzania.\u000aThe Niger-Congo language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages.\u000aThe Khoisan languages number about fifty and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.\u000a\u000aFollowing the end of colonialism, nearly all African countries adopted official languages that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as Swahili, Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa). In numerous countries, English and French (see African French) are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. Arabic, Portuguese, Afrikaans and Malagasy are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres.\u000aCulture{{Main}} \u000aSome{{Which?}} aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practiced in recent years as a result of years of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalourise African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of Vodou and other forms of spirituality. In recent years, traditional African culture has become synonymous with rural poverty and subsistence farming.\u000a\u000aVisual art and architectureAfrican art and architecture reflect the diversity of African cultures. The oldest existing examples of art from Africa are 82,000-year-old beads made from Nassarius shells that were found in the Aterian levels at Grotte des Pigeons, Taforalt, Morocco.{{Citation needed}} The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world''s tallest structure for 4,000 years, until the completion of Lincoln Cathedral around the year 1300. The stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe are also noteworthy for their architecture, and the complexity of monolithic churches at Lalibela, Ethiopia, of which the Church of Saint George is representative.{{Citation needed}}\u000aMusic and dance{{Main}}\u000a\u000aEgypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern samba, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, and rock. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of Afrobeat and Highlife music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of North Africa and Southern Africa. Arab influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, Western influences are apparent due to colonisation.\u000aSportsFifty-three African countries have football (soccer) teams in the Confederation of African Football, while Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana have advanced to the knockout stage of recent FIFA World Cups. South Africa will host the 2010 World Cup tournament, and will be the first African country to do so.Cricket is popular in some African nations. South Africa and Zimbabwe have Test status, while Kenya is the leading non-test team in One-Day International cricket and has attained permanent One-Day International status. The three countries jointly hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Namibia is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. Morocco in northern Africa has also hosted the 2002 Morocco Cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. Rugby is a popular sport in South Africa.\u000aReligion{{Main}}\u000aAfricans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs"African Religion on the Internet", Stanford University and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are too sensitive a topic for governments with mixed populations.{{cite web}} According to the World Book Encyclopedia, Islam is the largest religion in Africa, followed by Christianity. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, 45% of the population are Muslims, 40% are Christians and less than 15% are non-religious or follow African religions. A small number of Africans are Hindu, Baha''i, or have beliefs from the Judaic tradition. Examples of African Jews are the Beta Israel, Lemba peoples and the Abayudaya of Eastern Uganda.\u000aTerritories and regions{{Main}}\u000aThe countries in this table are categorised according to the scheme for geographic subregions used by the United Nations, and data included are per sources in cross-referenced articles.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(54,0,'{{About}}\u000a{{Expert-subject}}\u0009 \u000a{{Cleanup-reorganize}}\u000a{{Anthropology}}\u000aAnthropology is the study of humanity. Anthropology has origins in the natural sciences, the humanities social sciences.Wolf, Eric (1994) Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People. Current Anthropology 35: 1-7. p.227 The term "anthropology", {{pron-en}}, is from the Greek {{lang}}, anthr\u014dpos, "human", and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia, "discourse" or "study", and was first used by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9ron when discussing his encounters with Tasmanian Aborigines.Flannery, T.F. (1994) The Future Eaters: An ecological history of the Australasian lands and people Chatswood: New South Wales ISBN 0802139434Anthropology''s basic concerns are "What defines Homo sapiens?", "Who are the ancestors of modern Homo sapiens?", "What are humans'' physical traits?", "How do humans behave?", "Why are there variations and differences among different groups of humans?", "How has the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens influenced its social organization and culture?" and so forth.In the United States, contemporary anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: cultural anthropology (also called "social anthropology"), archaeology, linguistic anthropology and biological/physical anthropology.AAAnet.org The so-called "four-field" approach to anthropology is reflected in many undergraduate textbooks(Kottak, C) as well as anthropology programs (e.g. Michigan, Berkeley, Penn, etc.). At universities in the United Kingdom, and much of Europe, these "sub-fields" are frequently housed in separate departments and are seen as distinct disciplines.Layton, Robert (1998) An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.The social and cultural sub-field has been heavily influenced by structuralist and post-modern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies (an arena more typically in the remit of sociologists). During the 1970s and 1980s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline.Geertz, Behar, Clifford & James During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, anthropology as a discipline has lacked cohesion over the last several decades. This has even led to departments diverging, for example in the 1998-9 academic year at Stanford University, where the "scientists" and "non-scientists" divided into two departments: anthropology, and cultural & social Anthropology.Stanford University Bulletin 1998-1999 pg. 213, Sul-derivatives.stanford.edu (Anthropology at Stanford later reunified in the 2008-9 academic year)Stanford University Bulletin 2007-2008 pg. 269\u000aOverviewAnthropology is traditionally divided into four sub-fields, each with its own further branches: biological or physical anthropology, [social anthropology] or cultural anthropology, archaeology and anthropological linguistics. These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.Biological anthropology or Physical anthropology, focuses on the study of human populations using an evolutionary framework. Biological anthropologists have theorized about how the globe has become populated with humans (e.g. the "Out of Africa" and "multi-regional evolution" debate), as well as tried to explain geographical human variation and race. Many biological anthropologists studying modern human populations identify their field as human ecology - itself linked to sociobiology. Human ecology uses evolutionary theory to understand phenomena among contemporary human populations. Another large sector of biological anthropology is primatology, where anthropologists focus on understanding other primate populations. Methodologically, primatologists borrow heavily from field biology and ecology in their research. Cultural anthropology is also called socio-cultural anthropology or social anthropology (especially in Great Britain). It is the study of culture, and is often based on ethnography. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research, namely a monograph or book. Ethnography is a grounded, inductive method, that heavily relies on participant-observation. Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. In some European countries, all cultural anthropology is known as ethnology (a term coined and defined by Adam F. Koll\u00e1r in 1783).Han F. Vermeulen, "The German Invention of V\u00f6lkerkunde: Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1740-1798." In: Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore, eds. The German Invention of Race. 2006.The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of cultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal. Cultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).Archaeology is the study of human material culture, including both artifacts (older pieces of human culture) carefully gathered in situ, museum pieces and modern garbage.{{cite news}}  Archaeologists work closely with biological anthropologists, art historians, physics laboratories (for dating), and museums. They are charged with preserving the results of their excavations and are often found in museums. Typically, archaeologists are associated with "digs," or excavation of layers of ancient sites.Archaeologists subdivide time into cultural periods based on long-lasting artifacts: the Paleolithic, the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, which are further subdivided according to artifact traditions and culture region, such as the Oldowan or the Gravettian. In this way, archaeologists provide a vast frame of reference for the places human beings have traveled, their ways of making a living, and their demographics. Archaeologists also investigate nutrition, symbolization, art, systems of writing, and other physical remnants of human cultural activity.Linguistic anthropology (also called anthropological linguistics) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics, pragmatics, cognitive linguistics, semiotics, discourse analysis, and narrative analysis.Salzmann, Zden\u011bk. (1993) Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.Linguistic anthropology is divided into its own sub-fields: descriptive linguistics the construction of grammars and lexicons for unstudied languages; historical linguistics, including the reconstruction of past languages, from which our current languages have descended; ethnolinguistics, the study of the relationship between language and culture, and sociolinguistics, the study of the social functions of language. Anthropological linguistics is also concerned with the evolution of the parts of the brain that deal with language.Anthropology.netBecause anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see History of Anthropology), including but not limited to fossil-hunting, exploring, documentary film-making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity dealings and curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy and religious studies,Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy.  A History of Anthropological Theory. Broadview Press. 2003. p. 11-12George Stocking, "Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology." In George Stocking, The Ethnographer''s Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992):342-361. it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.Leaf, Murray. Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.  Columbia University Press. 1979On the one hand this has led to instability in many American anthropology departments, resulting in the division or reorganization of sub-fields (e.g. at Stanford, Duke, and most recently at Harvard).News.harvard.edu However, seen in a positive light, anthropology is one of the few places in many American universities where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another. As such, anthropology has also been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, global studies, human-computer interaction, and various ethnic studies.\u000aBasic trendsThere are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.{{Citation needed}} The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place or thing in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia. The specific focus of social and cultural anthropology has significantly changed. Initially the sub-field was focused on the study of cultures around the world. In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.Rosaldo, Renato.  Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo.  The Anthropology of Globalization. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variationRobert Jurmaiine, Lynn Kiilgore, Wenda Treavathan, and Russell L. Ciochon.  Introduction to Physical Anthropology. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. 2007, chapters I, III and IV.; Wompack, Mari.  Being Human. Prentice Hall. 2001, pp. 11-20. and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures)Brown, Donald.  Human Universals. McGraw Hill. 1991; Roughley, Neil.  Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives. Walter de Gruyter Publishing. 2000  They use many different methods of study, but modern population genetics, participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists "into the field" which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called "fieldwork."  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs. Due to the interest in variation, anthropologists are drawn to the study of human extremes, aberrations and other unusual circumstances, such as headhunting, whirling dervishes, whether there were real Hobbit people, snake handling, and glossolalia (speaking in tongues), just to list a few.At the same time, anthropologists urge, as part of their quest for scientific objectivity, cultural relativism, which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology. This is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture''s values or viewpoints, but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.Levi-Strauss, Claude.  The Savage Mind. 1962; Womack, Mari.  Being Human. 2001Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide, infanticide, racism, mutilation including circumcision and subincision, and torture. Topics like racism, slavery or human sacrifice, therefore, attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficienciesHarris, Marvin.  Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches. to genesTimeshighereducation.co.uk to acculturation have been proposed, not to mention theories of  colonialism and many others as root causes of Man''s inhumanity to man. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as "racism" and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.AAAnet.orgSciencemag.org, Shanklin, Eugenia. 1994. Anthropology & Race; Faye V. Harrison. 1995. "The Persistent Power of ''Race'' in the Cultural and Political Economy of Racism." Annual Review of Anthropology. 24:47-74. Allan Goodman. 1995. "The Problematics of "Race" in Contemporary Biological Anthropology." In Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science.; Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, 1945-.  "Melanin, Afrocentricity...," 36(1993):33-58.; see Stanford''s recent collection of overarching bibliographies on race and racism, Library.stanford.eduAlong with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic, of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levallois help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the American Anthropological Association, which was founded in 1903.AAAnet.org Membership is made up of Anthropologists from around the globe.AAAnet.org  Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as geology, physics, zoology, paleontology, anatomy, music theory, art history, sociology and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.Johanson, Donald and Kate Wong. Lucy''s Legacy. Kindle Books. 2007; Netti, Bruno. The study of ethnomusicology.  University of Illinois Press. 2005. Chapter One\u000aHistory{{Main}}\u000aThe first use of the term "anthropology" in English to refer to a natural science of humankind was apparently in 1593, the first of the "logies" to be coined.Urbanowicz, Charles. In the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, reprinted online, Csuchico.edu It took Immanuel Kant 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, his Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View.Foucault, Michel.  "Introduction" to his 1961 translation of Kant''s work, reprinted, Generation-online.org  Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, however, as he never left his region of Germany nor did he study any cultures besides his own, and in fact, describes the need for anthropology as a corollary field to his own primary field of philosophy.Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant''s Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., ISBN 0521790387.  He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772. Anthropology is thus primarily an Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment endeavor.Historians of anthropology, like Marvin Harris,Harris, Marvin.  The Rise of Anthropological Theory.  Alta Mira Press. 2000 (revised from 1968); Harris, Marvin.  Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times. Altamira. 1998 indicate two major frameworks within which empirical anthropology has arisen: interest in comparisons of people over space and interest in longterm human processes or humans as viewed through time. Harris dates both to Classical Greece and Classical Rome, specifically Herodotus, often called the "father of history" and the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient Celtic and Germanic peoples. Herodotus first formulated some of the persisting problems of anthropology.Harris, 1968, op cit. pp. 8-52; Leaf 1970, op cit. pp. 1-13; Erickson and Murph, 2003, pp. 21-25Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered "different" from themselves in terms of geography.  John of Plano Carpini reported of his stay among the Mongols. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European cultureResources for a History of AnthropologyMarco Polo''s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.Marco Polo''s Asia Polo''s travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name "the father of modern anthropology."The Renaissance Foundations of AnthropologyAnother candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval Persian scholar Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n B\u012br\u016bn\u012b in the 11th century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent. Like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive participant observation with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons.Akbar S. Ahmed (1984). "Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist", RAIN 60, p. 9-10. However, others argue that he can hardly be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", Anthropological Quarterly 68 (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the Middle East, Mediterranean and especially South Asia.J. T. Walbridge (1998). "Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam", Journal of the History of Ideas 59 (3), p. 389-403.Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", Anthropological Quarterly 68 (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193. Biruni''s tradition of comparative cross-cultural study continued in the Muslim world through to Ibn Khaldun''s work in the 14th century.West Asian views on black Africans during the medieval eraMost scholars{{Citation needed}} consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the Age of Enlightenment, a period when Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the 15th century as a result of the first European colonization wave. The traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology, and sociology then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the social sciences, of which anthropology was a part.Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of Classics and Egyptology informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as Johann Gottfried Herder and later Wilhelm Dilthey, whose work formed the basis for the "culture concept," which is central to the discipline.\u000aInstitutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of natural history (expounded by authors such as Buffon) that occurred during the European colonization of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the "human primitives" overseen by colonial administrations.There was a tendency in late 18th century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.Early anthropology was divided between proponents of unilinealism, who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as diffusionism.Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press. Most 19th-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the 19th century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism has been that many social science scholars (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focus disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuses disproportionately on the "Other";Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press. this has changed over the last part of the 20th century as anthropologists increasingly also study Western subjects, particularly variation across class, region, or ethnicity within Western societies, and other social scientists increasingly take a global view of their fields.\u000a20th centuryIn the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural and biological sciences seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The humanities generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras.The social sciences have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences. In particular, social sciences often develop statistical descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.Wallerstein, Immanuel. (2003) "Anthropology, sociology, and other dubious disciplines." Current Anthropology 44:453-466.Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe (Italy, Greece, and the successors to the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on cross-cultural comparison and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason," in Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32-58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building nationalist perspectives. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (eg, museums of several kinds).Gellner, Ernest. (1998) Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma. New York: Cambridge University Press.In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, anthropology in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) Soviet and Western anthropology. New York: Columbia University Press.\u000aCountries\u000aBritain\u000aE. B. Tylor ( 2 October 1832 \u2013 2 January 1917) and James George Frazer ( 1 January 1854 \u2013 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern social anthropology in Britain. Though Tylor undertook a field trip to Mexico, both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not fieldwork, mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of "uniformity of mankind".Stocking, George Jr. (1963) "Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention," American Anthropologist, 65:783-799, 1963 Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of cultural diffusionism, stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: "independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race [sic] to another."Tylor, E. B. (1865) Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization. London: John Murray.Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."Tylor, E. B. (1871) Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom. 2 vols. London, John Murray. However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious feelings in human beings, proposing a theory of animism as the earliest stage, and noting that "religion" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of The Golden Bough, analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally.Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, were particularly interested in fieldwork, nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative.Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present (synchronic analysis, rather than diachronic or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. Cambridge University financed a multidisciplinary expedition to the Torres Strait Islands in 1898, organized by Alfred Court Haddon and including a physician-anthropologist, William Rivers, as well as a linguist, a botanist, other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski (1884\u20131942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of fieldwork in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in New Guinea. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.Malinowski, Bronis\u0142aw (1967) A diary in the strict sense of the term. New York, Harcourt, Brace & World [1967]He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by British anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922) advocated an approach to fieldwork that became standard in the field: getting "the native''s point of view" through participant observation. Theoretically, he advocated a functionalist interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the Interwar period, with key contributions coming from the Polish-British Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski and Meyer FortesJack Goody (1995) The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970 review at Links.jstor.orgA. R. Radcliffe-Brown also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the Andaman Islands in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists \u00c9mile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply The Andaman Islanders) that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as structural-functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski''s functionalism, and was quite different from the later French structuralism, which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown''s influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the British Commonwealth. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include The Nuer, by Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, and The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi, by Meyer Fortes; well-known edited volumes include African Systems of Kinship and Marriage and African Political Systems.Max Gluckman, together with many of his colleagues at the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute and students at Manchester University, collectively known as the Manchester School, took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it "contributed to the erosion of Christianity, the growth of cultural relativism, an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of diachronic modes of analysis with synchronic, all of which are central to modern culture."Thomas William Heyck at Links.jstor.org The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486-1488 doi:10.2307/2171126Later in the 1960s and 1970s, Edmund Leach and his students Mary Douglas and Nur Yalman, among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of L\u00e9vi-Strauss; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from physical anthropology and primatology, which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of Classics, Egyptology, and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of folklore, museum studies, human geography, sociology, social relations, ethnic studies, cultural studies, and social work.\u000aUnited States\u000a19th Century to 1940sFrom its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of Native American societies.\u000aCultural anthropology in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Smithsonian Institution''s Bureau of American Ethnology, men such as John Wesley Powell and Frank Hamilton Cushing.Lewis Henry Morgan (1818\u20131881), a lawyer from Rochester, New York, became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the Iroquois. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as Edward Tylor), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from savagery, to barbarism, to civilization. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.This would be influential on the ideas of Karl Marx, who dedicated Das Kapital to Morgan.\u000aBoasian anthropologyFranz Boas established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct cultures, rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the natural sciences, were not possible.In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press. Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.\u000aBoas used his positions at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie, Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict, who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir''s focus on Native American languages helped establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on Indo-European languages.The publication of Alfred Kroeber''s textbook, Anthropology, marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the ''Culture and Personality'' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.Though such works as Coming of Age in Samoa and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia''s anthropology department, but she was sidelined by Ralph Linton, and Mead was limited to her offices at the AMNH.\u000aCanadaCanadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, Jesuit missionaries such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 1600s, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Domain of Canada.True anthropology began with a Government department: the Geological Survey of Canada, and George Mercer Dawson (director in 1895). Dawson''s support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910. Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian Edward Sapir.\u000aFrance\u000aAnthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.Most commentators consider Marcel Mauss (1872\u20131950), nephew of the influential sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim''s Ann\u00e9e Sociologique group; and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as ''differentiated'' as European nation states.Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: Essay on the Gift a seminal analysis of exchange and reciprocity, and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.Mauss, Marcel (1938) "A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self.," in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as "Une categorie de l''Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de ''Moi''," for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 68.Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as surrealism and primitivism which drew on ethnography for inspiration. Marcel Griaule and Michel Leiris are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ethnologie was restricted to museums, such as the Mus\u00e9e de l''Homme founded by Paul Rivet, and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of folklore.Above all, however, it was Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence his structuralism exerted across multiple disciplines, L\u00e9vi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as Maurice Godelier and Fran\u00e7oise H\u00e9ritier who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France''s anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories (CNRS) rather than academic departments in universities.Other influential writers in the 1970s include Pierre Clastres, who explains in his books on the Guayaki tribe in Paraguay that "primitive societies" actively oppose the institution of the state. Therefore, these stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but took the active choice of conjuring the institution of authority as a separate function from society. The leader is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups ("international relations") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.Bartholomew Dean \u201cCritical Re-vision: Clastres'' Chronicle and the optic of primitivism\u201d, 2002 In Best of Anthropology Today, 1974-2000, ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. Amazon.comThe most important French social theorist since Foucault and L\u00e9vi-Strauss is Pierre Bourdieu, who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Like Mauss and others before him, however, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the Kabyles of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.\u000aOther countriesAnthropology in Greece and Portugal is much influenced by British anthropology.{{Citation needed}} In Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the folklore called laographia (laography), in the form of "a science of the interior", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science "of the outside".Genevi\u00e8ve Zo\u00efa, \u00ab L''anthropologie en Gr\u00e8ce \u00bb, Terrain, Num\u00e9ro 14\u2014L''incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990) , [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005,  Terrain.revues.org, Consult\u00e9 le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}} In Italy, the development of ethnology and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning.Grottanelli, Vinigi Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Developments (and Comments and Reply).

After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as ''sociocultural'' anthropology.In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the natural sciences. Some anthropologists, such as Lloyd Fallers and Clifford Geertz, focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as Julian Steward and Leslie White, focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche\u2014an approach popularized by Marvin Harris.Economic anthropology as influenced by Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton challenged standard neoclassical economics to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology''s paradigm began to fragment as Max Gluckman and Peter Worsley experimented with Marxism and authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach incorporated L\u00e9vi-Strauss''s structuralism into their work.Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis. Authors such as David Schneider, Clifford Geertz, and Marshall Sahlins developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the Algerian War of Independence and opposition to the Vietnam War;Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld. Marxism became an increasingly popular theoretical approach in the discipline.Nugent, Stephen Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13) By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as Reinventing Anthropology worried about anthropology''s relevance.Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in Eric Wolf''s Europe and the People Without History, have been central to the discipline. In the 80s books like Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter pondered anthropology''s ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as Antonio Gramsci and Michel Foucault moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by Marshall Sahlins (again), who drew on L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Fernand Braudel to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. Also influential in these issues were Nietzsche, Heidegger, the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, Derrida and Lacan.Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences American Anthropologist 100:" 716-731In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as George Marcus and James Clifford pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by Feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics.Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press. Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theorizing and methods became de rigueur as part of the ''post-modern moment'' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author''s methodology, cultural, gender and racial positioning, and their influence on his or her ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of postmodernism that was popular contemporaneously.Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-50 Currently anthropologists pay attention to a wide variety of issues pertaining to the contemporary world, including globalization, medicine and biotechnology, indigenous rights, virtual communities, and the anthropology of industrialized societies.\u000aControversies about its historyAnthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) Anthropology & the Colonial Encounter. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.Some commentators have contended:\u000a\u000aThat the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.   (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-29.\u000aThat anthropologists typically have more power than the people they study and hence their knowledge-making is a form of theft in which the anthropologist gains something for him or herself at the expense of informants.\u000aThat ethnographic work was often ahistorical, writing about people as if they were &#34;out of time&#34; in an &#34;ethnographic present&#34; (Johannes Fabian, Time and Its Other).\u000a\u000a\u000aMilitaryAnthropologists'' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.But by the 1940s, many of Boas'' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the "Axis" (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Office of War Information). At the same time, David H. Price''s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn Project Camelot).Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot. Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement and a great many resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association (AAA).In the decades since the Vietnam war the tone of cultural and social anthropology, at least, has been increasingly politicized, with the dominant liberal tone of earlier generations replaced with one more radical, a mix of, and varying degrees of, Marxist, feminist, anarchist, post-colonial, post-modern, Foucauldian, identity-based, and more.D''Andrade, Roy (1995) "Moral Models in Anthropology." Current Anthropology 36: 399-408.Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. The AAA''s current ''Statement of Professional Responsibility'' clearly states that "in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given."However, anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army''s strategy in Afghanistan.CSmonitor.com The Christian Science Monitor reports that "Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs" in Afghanistan, under the Human Terrain System (HTS) program; additionally, HTS teams are working with the US military in Iraq.Army.mil\u000aMajor discussions\u000aFocus on other culturesSome authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies). For example, the classic of urban anthropology, Ulf Hannerz in the introduction to his seminal Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology mentions that the "Third World" had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in "other cultures" looked for them far away and started to look "across the tracks" only in late 1960s.Ulf Hannerz (1980) "Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology", ISBN 0231083769, p. 1Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author''s "home". It is also argued that other fields of study, like History and Sociology, on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.Jack Goody (2007) The Theft of History Cambridge University Press ISBN 0521870690In France, the study of existing contemporary society has been traditionally left to sociologists, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like Terrain ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by Marc Aug\u00e9 (Le Centre d''anthropologie des mondes contemporains, the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies). The same approach of focusing on "modern world" topics by Terrain, was also present in the British Manchester School of the 1950s.{{Citation needed}}\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a{{Wikipedia-Books}}\u000a{{Main}}\u000a\u000aAnthropological Index Online (AIO)\u000aAnthrozoology\u000aEthnology\u000aEthology\u000aFolklore\u000aHuman ethology\u000aHuman evolution\u000aIntangible Cultural Heritage\u000aLegal anthropology\u000aMadison Grant\u000aMemetics\u000aPhilosophical anthropology\u000aPrehistoric medicine\u000aSociology\u000aSystems theory in anthropology\u000aTheological anthropology, which is not part of anthropology but a sub-field of theology\u000aPeriodic Table of Human Sciences / Anthropology in Tinbergen''s four questions\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{reflist}}\u000a\u000a\u000aFurther reading\u000aDictionaries and encyclopedias\u000a\u000aBarfield, Thomas (1997).

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(55,0,'{{redirect}}\u000a{{About}}\u000a{{legal status}}Citizenship is the state of being a citizen of a particular social, political, or national community.Citizenship status, under social contract theory, carries with it both rights and responsibilities. "Active citizenship" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public , volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, schools in some countries provide citizenship education. Citizenship was equated by Virginia Leary (1999) as connoting "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."{{cite news}}The group of all citizens is the Citizenry.\u000aNational citizenship{{also}}Generally citizenship is seen as the relationship between an individual and a particular nation. In ancient Greece, the main political entity was the city-state, and citizens were members of particular city-states. In the past five hundred years, with the rise of the nation-state, citizenship is most closely identified with being a member of a particular nation. To some extent, certain entities cross national boundaries such as trade organizations, non-governmental organizations as well as multi-national corporations, and sometimes the term "citizen of the world" applies in the sense of people having less ties to a particular nation and more of a sense of belonging to the world in general.\u000aSupranational citizenshipIn recent years, some intergovernmental organizations have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,see Daniele Archibugi, The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008 where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.\u000aEuropean Union (EU) citizenship{{main}}\u000aThe Maastricht Treaty introduced the concept of citizenship of the European Union. Article 17 (1) of the amended EC TreatyTreaty of Rome (consolidated version) states that Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State  shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship.\u000aThe amended EC Treaty establishes certain minimal rights for EU citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guarantees a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provides a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the EU citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.Union citizens have also extensive rights to move in order to exercise economic activity in any of the Member States (Articles 39, 43, 49 EC), which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.\u000aPolis citizenship{{main}}\u000aThe first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the ancient Greek times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. In those days citizenship was not seen as a public matter, separated from the private life of the individual person. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one\u2019s everyday life in the polis. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: \u201cTo take no part in the running of the community''s affairs is to be either a beast or a god!\u201d This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.However, an important aspect of polis citizenship was exclusivity. Citizenship in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as Medieval cities that practiced polis citizenship, was exclusive and inequality of status was widely accepted. Citizens had a much higher status than non-citizens: Women, slaves or \u2018barbarians\u2019. For example, women were seen to be irrational and incapable of political participation (although some, most notably Plato, disagreed). Methods used to determine whether someone could be a citizen or not could be based on wealth (the amount of taxes one paid), political participation, or heritage (both parents had to be born in the polis).In the Roman Empire, polis citizenship changed form: Citizenship was expanded from small scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realised that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas.  Citizenship in the Roman era was no longer a status of political agency; it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law. (See Civis romanus sum.)\u000aHonorary citizenshipSome countries extend "honorary citizenship" to those whom they consider to be especially admirable or worthy of the distinction.By act of United States Congress and presidential assent, honorary United States citizenship has been awarded to only seven individuals.\u000aHonorary Canadian  citizenship requires the unanimous approval of Parliament.  The only people to ever receive honorary Canadian citizenship are Raoul Wallenberg posthumously in 1985, Nelson Mandela in 2001, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso in 2006, Aung San Suu Kyi in 2007 and Prince Karim Aga Khan in 2009.\u000aIn 2002 South Korea awarded honorary citizenship to Dutch football (soccer) coach Guus Hiddink who successfully and unexpectedly took the national team to the semi-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Honorary citizenship was also awarded to Hines Ward, a black Korean American football player, in 2006 for his efforts to minimize discrimination in Korea against half-Koreans.American actress Angelina Jolie received an honorary Cambodian citizenship in 2005 due to her humanitarian efforts.\u000aCricketers Matthew Hayden and Herschelle Gibbs were awarded honorary citizenship of St. Kitts and Nevis in March 2007 due to their record-breaking innings in the 2007 Cricket World Cup.In Germany the honorary citizenship is awarded by cities, towns and sometimes federal states. The honorary citizenship ends with the death of the honoured, or, in exceptional cases, when it is taken away by the council or parliament of the city, town, or state. In the case of war criminals, all such honours were taken away by "Article VIII, section II, letter i of the directive 38 of the Allied Control Council for Germany" on October 12, 1946 In some cases, honorary citizenship was taken away from members of the former GDR regime, e.g. Erich Honecker, after the collapse of the GDR in 1989/90. {{Citation needed}}In Ireland, "honorary citizenship" bestowed on a foreigner is in fact full legal citizenship including the right to reside in Ireland, to vote etc.According to the Chapter II, Article 29, Paragraph ''e)'' of the Cuban Constitution, Cuban citizens by birth are those foreigners who, by virtue of their exceptional merits won in the struggles for Cuba\u2019s liberation, were considered Cuban citizens by birth{{cite web}}. Che Guevara was made an honorary citizen of Cuba by Fidel Castro for his part in the Cuban Revolution, of which Guevara later renounced in his well known farewell letter.{{cite web}}Historically, many states limited citizenship to only a proportion of their population, thereby creating a citizen class with political rights superior to other sections of the population, but equal with each other.  The classical example of a limited citizenry was Athens where slaves, women, and resident foreigners (called metics) were excluded from political rights. The Roman Republic forms another example (see Roman citizenship), and, more recently, the nobility of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had some of the same characteristics.{{Honorary Citizenship}}\u000aSchool subject{{main}}\u000aCitizenship has been introduced as a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state-run schools in England. Some state schools offer an examination in this subject, all state schools have a statutory requirement to report student''s progress in Citizenship.{{cite web}}Citizenship is not offered as a normal General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) course in many schools. Only some schools offer this subject as a GCSE course, and this is usually not a compulsory subject. Some schools may even give students an option, whether to study Citizenship or not at GCSE.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(56,0,'{{Expert-subject}}\u000a{{Cleanup-rewrite}}\u000a{{Infobox Military Conflict}}The Darfur Conflict{{cite news}}{{cite web}} is an ongoing guerrilla conflict or civil war centered on the Darfur region of Sudan. It began in February 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) groups in Darfur took up arms, accusing the Sudanese government of oppressing black Africans in favor of Arabs. One side of the conflict is composed mainly of the official Sudanese military and police, and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group recruited mostly from the Afro-Arab Abbala tribes of the northern Rizeigat region in Sudan; these tribes are mainly camel-herding nomads. The other combatants are made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supports the Janjaweed, multiple human rights groups have accused it of providing financial assistance to the militia and of participating in joint attacks targeting civilians.{{cite news}}{{dead link}}{{cite web}}There are various estimates on the number of human casualties, ranging from under twenty thousand to several hundred thousand dead, from either direct combat or starvation and disease engendered by the conflict. There have also been mass displacements and coercive migrations, forcing millions into refugee camps or over the border and creating a large humanitarian crisis.The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February, 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue further peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks, and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8533097.stm However, talks have been disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the February agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, has said they will boycott further negotiations. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8659037.stm\u000a\u000aList of abbreviations used in this article\u000aAU: African Union\u000aDLF: Darfur Liberation Front\u000aICC: International Criminal Court\u000aIDP: Internally Displaced Person \u000aJEM: Justice and Equality Movement\u000aSLM/A/A: Sudan Liberation Movement/Army\u000aSLM/A: Sudan Liberation Movement\u000aSPLA: Sudan People''s Liberation Army\u000aUN: United Nations \u000aUNAMID: United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur\u000aUNSC: United Nations Security Council \u000aThe North/South divideThe Sudan conflict is typically characterized as between the predominately Arab/Muslim North and the non-Arab/Muslim "African" South. http://humanrights.change.org/blog/view/sudan_a_history_in_three-part_disharmony_part_i Dr Deng (Sudanese known journalist) explains that Northeners'' identification with Arabism, "is the result of a process in which races and religions were ranked, with Arabs and Muslims respected as free, superior and a race of slave masters, while Negroes and heathens were viewed as legitimate target of slavery, if they were not in fact already slaves." http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why+peace+is+elusive:+The+government+has+suspended+the+peace+talks...-a093230771 from a conference on North-South relations: "Northern intellectuals look at Southerners as ''tribes-men'', while they refer to the Northerners as ''people''.

Since then the activist group has been accused of spending 80% of their revenue on awareness raising. http://blogs.ssrc.org/sudan/2009/06/29/does-save-darfur-feed-darfur/ Various sources have claimed it is a war waged by Muslim Arabs against Christian and Animist black Africans. However, this distinction is not always true. The conflict''s origin goes back to land disputes between semi-nomadic livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture. Darfur and the Genocide Debate, Scott Straus, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 84, No. 1 (Jan. - Feb., 2005), pp. 123-133 Because those who claim black "African" descent are typically sedentary while the herders are typically of "Arab" descent, the portrayal of the conflict as an ethnic one makes a description of the conflict easier and also allows for a more emotional storyline. In reality, however, due to years of intermarriage, the physical distinctions between "Arabs" and black "Africans" have been narrowed to the point where distinctions are subjective and it is tribal, and therefore occupational, divisions that mark the true point of conflict. In fact, many of the victims of the atrocities in Darfur were also Muslim.Darfur and the Genocide Debate, Scott Straus, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 84, No. 1 (Jan. - Feb., 2005), pp. 123-133The ethno-linguistic Arab identity is not color based, as many western observers assume. Sudan is occupied by black Africans who speak Arabic among 400 other languages. With over 500 tribes in Sudan, the ethnic divisions are far more diverse than Arabs versus Africans.{{citation needed}}Despite the media statements, some are skeptical over the accused genocide. They describe the conflict as one of a complex civil war, not a race-based genocideInsert footnote text here. The Sudan is home to over 500 tribes, 400 languages, and 200 religions. The Janjaweed militiamen are not only Arab, but west Africans as well. The actual conflict is not about race or religion, but resources as the nomadic tribes facing drought are going after the territory of sedentary farmers. A History of Modern Sudan, Peter K. Bechtold, Middle East Studies Journal, Vol. 63,  2009\u000aInternational response{{Main}}\u000aInternational attention to the Darfur conflict largely began with reports by the advocacy organizations Amnesty International in July 2003 and the International Crisis Group in December 2003. However, widespread media coverage did not start until the outgoing United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Mukesh Kapila, called Darfur the "world''s greatest humanitarian crisis" in March 2004.Prunier, pp. 124-148 Organizations such as STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, later under the umbrella of Genocide Intervention Network, and the Save Darfur Coalition emerged and became particularly active in the areas of engaging the United States Congress and President on the issue and pushing for divestment nationwide, initially launched by Adam Sterling under the auspice of the Sudan Divestment Task Force. Particularly strong advocates have additionally included: New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, Sudan scholar Eric Reeves, Enough Project founder John Prendergast, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Samantha Power, photographers Ryan Spencer Reed, former Marine Brian Steidle, actress Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Farrow, Olympian Joey Cheek, actress Angelina Jolie, actor George Clooney, actor Jonah Hill, actress Salma Hayek, Save Darfur Coalition''s David Rubenstein, Slovenian humanitarian Tomo Kriznar, and all of those involved with the Genocide Intervention Network.  A movement advocating for humanitarian intervention has emerged in several countries.\u000aUnited Nations\u000a\u000aInternational Criminal CourtIn March 2005, the Security Council formally referred the situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, taking into account the report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, authorized by UN Security Council Resolution 1564 of 2004, but without mentioning any specific crimes.{{PDFlink}} Two permanent members of the Security Council, the United States and China, abstained from the vote on the referral resolution.Security Council Refers Situation in Darfur, Sudan, to Prosecutor of International Criminal Court, UN Press Release SC/8351, 31 March 2005 In April 2007, the Judges of the ICC issued arrest warrants against the former Minister of State for the Interior, Ahmed Haroun, and a Janjaweed leader, Ali Kushayb, for crimes against humanity and war crimes.Statement by Mr. Luis Moreno Ocampo, The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, to the United Nations Security Council pursuant to UNSCR 1593 (2005){{dead link}}, International Criminal Court, 5 June 2008 The Sudan Government said that the ICC had no jurisdiction to try Sudanese citizens and that it would not hand the two men over to authorities in the Hague.Staff. Sudan defiant on Darfur suspects BBC, 27 February 2007On 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor filed ten charges of war crimes against Sudan''s incumbent President Omar al-Bashir, three counts of genocide, five of crimes against humanity and two of murder. The Prosecutor has claimed that Mr. al-Bashir "masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their ethnicity. Leaders from three Darfur tribes are suing ICC prosecutor Luis-Moreno Ocampo for libel, defamation, and igniting hatred and tribalism.{{cite web}}After an arrest warrant was issued for the Sudanese president in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to have the genocide charges added. However, the Pre-Trial Chamber found that there was no reasonable ground to support the contention that he had a specific intent to commit genocide (dolus specialis), which is an intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a protected group. The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. This definition has recently been reaffirmed and discussed by the International Court of Justice in the Genocide case at some length (Bosnia v. Serbia) and the Pre-Trial Chamber cited the ICJ judgment with approval.Mr. al-Bashir is now the first incumbent head of state charged with crimes in the Rome Statute.{{cite news}} Bashir has rejected the charges and said, "Whoever has visited Darfur, met officials and discovered their ethnicities and tribes ... will know that all of these things are lies."{{cite web}}It is suspected that al-Bashir will not face trial in The Hague any time soon, as Sudan rejects the ICC''s jurisdiction.{{cite news}} Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University in Montreal and a former war crimes prosecutor, says although he may not go to trial, "He will effectively be in prison within the Sudan itself...Al-Bashir now is not going to be able to leave the Sudan without facing arrest."{{cite news}} The Prosecutor has publicly warned that authorities could arrest the President if he enters international airspace. The Sudanese government has announced the Presidential plane will be accompanied by jet fighters.{{cite web}} However, the Arab League has announced its solidarity with al-Bashir. Since the warrant, he has visited Qatar and Egypt. Both countries have refused to arrest him. The African Union also condemned the arrest warrant.Some analysts think that the ICC indictment is counterproductive and harms the peace process. Only days after the ICC indictment, Darfur rebels who were in a peace process with the Sudanese government declared there is no need to engage in a peace agreement because the ICC recognized the Sudanese president as a criminal. Previous ICC indictments, such as the arrest warrants of the LRA leadership in the ongoing war at northern Uganda, were also accused of harming peace processes by criminalizing one side of a war. Some believe that the arrest warrant against al-Bashir will hinder the efforts to establish peace in Darfur, and will undermine any effort to boost stability in Sudan.{{cite web}}\u000aCriticism of international response\u000aG\u00e9rard Prunier, a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argued that the world''s most powerful countries have largely limited themselves in expressing concerns and demand for the United Nations to take action in solving the genocide in Darfur. The UN, lacking both the funding and military support of the wealthy countries, has left the African Union to deploy a token force (AMIS) without a mandate to protect civilians. In the lack of foreign political will to address the political and economic structures that underlie the conflict, the international community has defined the Darfur conflict in humanitarian assistance terms and debated the label of "genocide."On 16 October 2006, Minority Rights Group (MRG) published a critical report, challenging that the UN and the great powers could have prevented the deepening crisis in Darfur and that few lessons appear to have been drawn from their ineptitude during the Rwandan Genocide. MRG''s executive director, Mark Lattimer, stated that: "this level of crisis, the killings, rape and displacement could have been foreseen and avoided ... Darfur would just not be in this situation had the UN systems got its act together after Rwanda: their action was too little too late.""UN could have averted Darfur crisis \u2013 MRG", Independent Online, 16 October 2006 On 20 October, 120 genocide survivors of The Holocaust, and the Cambodian and Rwandan Genocides, backed by six aid agencies, submitted an open letter to the European Union, calling on them to do more to end the atrocities in Darfur, with a UN peacekeeping force as "the only viable option." Aegis Trust director, James Smith, stated that while "the African Union has worked very well in Darfur and done what it could, the rest of the world hasn''t supported those efforts the way it should have done with sufficient funds and sufficient equipment.""Darfur call by genocide survivors", BBC, 20 October 2006Human Rights First claimed that over 90% of the light weapons currently being imported by Sudan and used in the conflict are from China;{{cite web}} however, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)''s "Arms Transfers Data for 2007", in 2003\u20132007, Sudan received 87 per cent of its major conventional weapons from Russia and 8 per cent from China."SIPRI Arms Transfers Data for 2007", SIPRI, 2008 Human rights advocates and opponents of the Sudanese government portray China''s role in providing weapons and aircraft as a cynical attempt to obtain oil just as colonial powers once supplied African chieftains with the military means to maintain control as they extracted natural resources.{{cite news}}{{Dead link}}{{cite news}}{{cite news}} According to China''s critics, China has offered Sudan support threatening to use its veto on the U.N.

For example, there have been statements such as: the "lobby to save Darfur ... is just the Israel lobby nicknamed", and by raising the issue of Darfur, the Israeli lobby is trying "to divert attention from Israel''s crimes, or the catastrophe of the war in Iraq","Since The Victims Are Arabs and Muslims" by Jihad Al-Khazen, Al-Hayat (English edition), 13 April 2007. and that Western attention to the Darfur crisis is "a cover for what is really being planned and carried out by the Western forces of hegemony and control in our Arab world."editorial in the newspaper Al-Gomhouriya (Egypt), 20 April 2007 Others also argue that "there is no ethnic cleansing being perpetrated" in Darfur, only "great instability" and "clashes between the Sudanese government, rebel movements and the Janjaweed."Sudanese journalist Babker ''Issa, editor of the daily newspaper Al-Raya, Al-Raya (Qatar), 20 April 2007.Additionally, a growing number of scholars in the academic community have been critical of the international response and the activist community. Columbia Professor, Mahmood Mamdani has written the book, Saviors and Survivors, which accuses the Save Darfur Coalition of exacerbating the situation in Darfur, focusing inaccurately on race and violence, rather than the systemic causes of the conflict. Marc Gustafson, of Oxford University, has argued that casualty rates have been inflated, and serious changes in the conflict''s scope, size and nature have been ignored since 2004.{{cite web}} Harvard professor, Alex de Waal has also been critical of the activist campaigns, claiming that activists have ignored the root causes of the conflict and are out of touch with the changes that have occurred in Darfur.  In 2007, in a response to allegations that the conflict is between Arabs and Blacks, in front of an African American audience, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir replied: \u000aTalk of Arabs killing Blacks is a lie, the government of Sudan is a government of Blacks, with all different ethnic backgrounds. We\u2019re all Africans. We\u2019re all Black.{{cite web}}\u000aEight people including U.S. Representatives James McGovern, John Lewis, Donna Edwards, Lynn Woolsey and Keith Ellison were arrested for civil disobedience in April 2009 when they spoke at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C. to raise awareness of genocide.In May 2009 the Mandate Darfur was canceled because the "Sudanese government is obstructing the safe passage of Darfurian delegates from Sudan."http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=93897443&source=Newsfeed{{dead link}} The Mandate was a conference that would have brought together 300 representatives from different regions of the civil society of Darfur. The conference was planned to be held in Addis Ababa in early May.One Canadian law student, Omar Ha-Redeye, notes that the crisis in Darfur had significant complicity by the U.N Security Council, the same party that referred the case to the ICC.  His position was that foreign government and NGO intervention had an escalating effect on the conflict, and could potentially make it worse, based on previous experiences in Uganda and Congo.{{cite web}}The UN military commander, General Martin Luther Agwai, has declared that the genocide in Darfur is over.  He claims there are still small incidents such as, "Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that." Agwai said these comments a week before he was scheduled to leave Darfur.{{cite news}}  On Sept. 10, 2009, a number of Darfur activists came forward in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, saying that reported figures had been deliberately inflated, including evidence used by the ICC.  They recanted their previous numbers and made the disclosure in the interest of peace and reconciliation, and in hopes that the ICC would withdraw their warrant.  However, SLM/A representatives dispute the claim and legitimacy of these activists.http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/09/200991083039170414.html Darfur groups ''padded'' death tolls\u000aMortality figuresSudanese authorities claim a death toll of roughly 19,500 civilians {{cite web}} while certain non-governmental organizations, such as the Coalition for International Justice, controversially claim that over 400,000 people have been killed.{{cite news}} In September 2004, the World Health Organization estimated there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to starvation. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence.How many have died in Darfur? By Russell Smith (BBC) 16 February 2005 A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died,Darfur death toll may be 300,000, say UK lawmakers (Reuters), 30 March 2005 and others have estimated even more. In March 2005, the UN''s Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland estimated that 10,000 were dying each month excluding deaths due to ethnic violence.UN''s Darfur death estimate soars (BBC) 14 March 2005 An estimated 2.7 million people had at that time been displaced from their homes, mostly seeking refuge in camps in Darfur''s major towns.{{cite web}} Two hundred thousand had fled to neighboring Chad. Reports of violent deaths compiled by the UN indicate between 6,000 and 7,000 fatalities from 2004 to 2007.{{cite web}}In May 2005, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) of the School of Public Health of the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain in Brussels, Belgium published an analysis of mortality in Darfur. Their estimate stated that from September 2003 to January 2005, between 98,000 and 181,000 persons had died in Darfur, including from 63,000 to 146,000 excess deaths.{{cite web}}On 28 April 2006, Dr. Eric Reeves argued that "extant data, in aggregate, strongly suggest that total excess mortality in Darfur, over the course of more than three years of deadly conflict, now significantly exceeds 450,000," but this has not been independently verified.Quantifying Genocide in Darfur Dr. Eric Reeves, 28 April 2006The UN disclosed on 22 April 2008 that it might have underestimated the Darfur death toll by nearly 50%.{{cite news}}Recently, the award-winning journalist, Afshin Rattansi, interviewed two women who returned from Darfur who claimed that they saw no evidence of genocide in Darfur. Collette Valentine, a TV producer visiting from the United Kingdom, and Ali Gunn, a British media consultant, attended the first \u201cInternational Conference on the Challenge Facing Women in Darfur\u201d in Al-Fasher in the north. Valentine said articles about Darfur in the international press make her feel as if she visited a completely different region, a completely different country.{{cite news}}In July 2009, the Christian Science Monitor published an op-ed stating that many of the published mortality rates have been misleading because they include a large number of people who have died of disease and malnutrition, as well as those who have died from direct violence. Therefore, when activist groups make statements indicating that "four hundred thousand people have been killed," they are misleading the public.The Genocide in Darfur is not what it seems Dr. Marc Gustafson, 19 August 2009In January 2010, The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters published an article in a special issue of The Lancet. The article, entitled Patterns of mortality rates in Darfur Conflict, estimated, with 95% confidence, that the excess number of deaths is between 178,258 and 461,520 (the mean being 298,271), with 80% of these due to diseases.{{cite web}}51 International peacekeepers have been killed in Darfur.\u000aSpreading of violence{{Main}}\u000aViolence in Darfur spread over the border to  eastern Chad and the Central African Republic.

It often connotes violent coercion, and is used interchangeably with the terms "displacement" or forced displacement. A specific form of forced migration is population transfer, which is a coherent policy to move unwanted persons, perhaps as an attempt at "ethnic cleansing". Someone who has experienced forced migration is a "forced migrant" or "displaced person".Forced migration has accompanied  persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced migration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region.Development-induced displacement is a subset of forced migration. Such displacement is the forcing of communities and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of economic development. It has been historically associated with the construction of dams for hydroelectric power and irrigation purposes but also appears due to many other activities, such as mining. The most well-known examples of development-induced displacement is a result of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China, and also the previous German expulsions.\u000aFurther readingAlexander Butts, Forced Migration and the Global Politics.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(58,0,'{{About}}\u000aGender is the wide set of characteristics that are seen to distinguish between male and female. It can extend from sex to social role or gender identity.  As a word, "gender" has more than one valid definition. In ordinary speech, it is used interchangeably with "sex" to denote the condition of being male or female. In the social sciences, however, it refers specifically to socially constructed and institutionalized differences such as gender roles.For example, the definition and use of the term in G. Argyrous and Frank Stilwell, Economics as a Social Science: Readings in Political Economy, 2nd ed., (Pluto Press, 2003), in the feminist economics section, pages 238-243, especially pages 233 and 234. The World Health Organization (WHO), for example, uses "gender" to refer to "the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women".{{cite web}} Some cultures have distinct gender-related social roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra of India and Pakistan.While the social sciences and gender studies approach gender as a social construct, the natural sciences, regard biological and behavioral differences in males and females as influencing the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence gender identity formation.  Biologist and feminist academic Anne Fausto-Sterling rejects the discourse of biological versus social determinism and advocates a deeper analysis of how interactions between the biological being and the social environment influence individuals'' capacities.Anne Fausto-Sterling, Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Men and Women (New York: Basic Books, 1992), 8.\u000aEtymology and usageThe historical meaning of gender is "things we treat differently because of their inherent differences"."In the Teutonic word, as in Latin genus and Greek \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 three main senses appear, (1) race or stock, (2) class or kind,\u000a(3) gender or sex ; the last, found in OE. and early ME., but not later, is the only sense in mod. Du., Da., and Sw." ''kin'', in Oxford English Dictionary.\u000aIt has three common applications in contemporary English. Most commonly, it is applied to the general differences between male and female entities, without any overt assumptions regarding biology or sociology. Sometimes, however, the usage is technical or overtly assumes a particular theory of human nature, which is usually made clear from the context. Finally, gender is also commonly applied to the independent concept of distinctive word categories in certain languages. Grammatical gender has little or nothing to do with differences between female and male.\u000aEnglish\u000a"Kind"The word gender comes from the Middle English gendre, a loanword from Norman-conquest-era Old French. This, in turn, came from Latin genus. Both words mean ''kind'', ''type'', or ''sort''. They derive ultimately from a widely attested Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root gen-,Julius Pokorny, ''gen'', in Indogermanisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch, (Bern: Francke, 1959, reprinted in 1989), pp. 373-75.''gen\u0259-'', in ''Appendix I: Indo-European Roots'', to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000).\u000awhich is also the source of kin, kind, king, and many other English words.Your Dictionary.com, ''Gen'', reformatted from AHD.\u000aIt appears in Modern French in the word genre (type, kind, also genre sexuel) and is related to the Greek root gen- (to produce), appearing in gene, genesis, and oxygen.\u000aAs a verb, it means breed in the King James Bible:\u000a{{quote}}Most uses of the root gen- in Indo-European languages refer either directly to what pertains to birth (for example pre-gn-ant) or, by extension, to natural, innate qualities and their consequent social distinctions\u000a(for example gentry, generation, gentile, genocide and eugenics).\u000aThe first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of gender as ''kind'' had already become obsolete.Gender (d\u0292e''nd\u0259\u0279), sb.

To talk of persons...of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder."Fowler''s Modern English Usage, 1926: p. 211.The sense of this can be felt by analogy with a modern expression like "persons of the female persuasion." It should be noted, however, that this was a recommendation, neither the Daily News nor Henry James citations (above) are "jocular" nor "blunders." Additionally, patterns of usage of gender have substantially changed since Fowler''s day (noun class above, and sexual stereotype below).\u000aSexual stereotypesThe word sex is sometimes used in the context of social roles of men and women \u2014 for example, the British Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 that ended exclusion of women from various official positions.Such usage was more common before the 1970s, over the course of which the feminist movement took the word gender into their own usage to describe their theory of human nature.Early in that decade, gender was used in ways consistent with both the history of English and the history of attestation of the root.However, by the end of the decade consensus was achieved among feminists regarding this theory and its terminology.The theory was that human nature is essentially epicene and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed.Matters pertaining to this theoretical process of social construction were labelled matters of gender.\u000a\u000a1998\u000aToday a return to separate single-sex schools may hasten the revival of separate gender roles. \u2014 Wendy Kaminer, ''The Trouble with Single-Sex Schools'', The Atlantic Monthly (April).\u000a\u000aThe American Heritage Dictionary uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction "is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels."Usage note: Gender, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, (2000).\u000a\u000a2000\u000aThe effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the sex (not gender) of the patient.\u000aIn peasant societies, gender (not sex) roles are likely to be more clearly defined.\u000a\u000aIn the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of gender in academia increased greatly, outnumbering uses of sex in the social sciences.David Haig, ''The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the Decline of Sex: Social Change in Academic Titles, 1945\u20132001'', Archives of Sexual Behavior 33 (2004): 87\u201396. Online at PubMed and Questia.Frequently, but not exclusively, this indicates acceptance of the feminist theory of human nature.However, in many instances, the term gender still refers to sexual distinction generally without such an assumption.\u000a\u000a2004\u000aAmong the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation \u2014 David Haig, The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the Decline of Sex.\u000aIn fact, the ideological distinction between sex and gender is only fitfully observed.\u000aUrdu\u000aUrdu recognizes hijra as a third gender in India and Pakistan since the mid to late 2000s.{{cite news}}{{cite news}}\u000aGreekGreek distinguishes biological from sociological in adjectives.In Greek, male biology and masculine grammatical inflection are denoted by arsenikos ({{Polytonic}}), in distinction to sociological masculinity, which is denoted by andrikos ({{Polytonic}}). Likewise, female biology and feminine grammatical inflection are denoted by th\u0113lukos (\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2); and sociological femininity is denoted by gunaikeios (\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c2, compare English gynaecology). This distinction is at least as old as Aristotle (see above). It is a different distinction to English, where ''female'' and ''male'' refer to animals as well as humans, but not to grammatical categories; whereas, ''feminine'' and ''masculine'' refer to grammatical categories as well as humans, but not properly to animals, except as anthropomorphism.\u000aGerman and Dutch\u000aGerman <Geschlecht> and Dutch <geslacht> make no distinction in nouns.In English, both ''sex'' and ''gender'' can be used in contexts where they could not be substituted \u2014 ''sexual intercourse'', ''safe sex'', ''sex worker'', or on the other hand, ''grammatical gender''. Other languages, like German or Dutch, use the same word, de:Geschlecht or nl:geslacht, to refer not only to biological sex, but social differences as well, making a distinction between biological ''sex'' and ''gender'' identity difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loanword Gender to achieve this distinction. Sometimes Geschlechtsidentit\u00e4t is used for ''gender'' (although it literally means ''gender identity'') and Geschlecht for ''sex''.See translation of Judith Butler''s Gender Trouble\u000aMore common is the use of modifiers: biologisches Geschlecht for ''biological sex'', Geschlechtsidentit\u00e4t for ''gender identity'' and Geschlechtsrolle for ''gender role'', and so on.\u000aSwedishSwedish makes clear distinction in nouns\u000a\u000agenus\u000ak\u00f6n\u000a\u000aIn Swedish, ''gender'' is translated with the linguistically cognate sv:genus, including sociological contexts, thus: Genusstudier (gender studies) and Genusvetenskap (gender science). ''Sex'' in Swedish, however, only signifies sexual relations, and not the proposed English dichotomy, a concept for which sv:k\u00f6n (also from PIE gen-) is used. A common distinction is then made between k\u00f6n (sex) and genus (gender), where the former refers only to biological sex. There are different opinions whether genus should involve biology but within the genusvetenskap which is strongly influenced by feminism it usually does not.distinguishes Sweden uses the words sv:k\u00f6nsroll and sv:k\u00f6nsidentitet (literally ''sex role'' and ''sex-identity'') for the English terms ''gender role'' and ''gender identity''.\u000aFrenchFrench has no distinction in noun: "sexe", but the distinction is supplied by the neologistic coinage "genre".In French, the word sexe is most widely used for both "sex" and "gender" in everyday contexts. However, the word genre is increasingly used to refer to gender in queer or academic contexts, such as the word transgenre (transgender) or the translation of Judith Butler''s book Gender Trouble as Trouble dans le genre. The term identit\u00e9 sexuelle was proposed for "gender" or "gender identity," although it can be confused with "sexual identity" (one''s identity as it relates to one''s sexual life).\u000aSociological genderGender identity is the gender a person self-identifies as. The concept of being a woman is considered to have more challenges, due to society not only viewing women as a social category but also as a felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity.Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. Thinking Gender. New York & London: Routledge, 1990 The term "woman" has chronically been used as a reference to and for the female body; this usage has been viewed as controversial by feminists, in the definement of "woman". There are qualitative analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; feminists challenge the dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and sex. Social identity refers to the common identification with a collectivity or social category which creates a common culture among participants concerned.Snow, D.A. and Oliver, P.E. (1995).

Chicago: Nelson-Hall. an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories; this is demonstrated by group processes and how inter-group relationships impact significantly on individuals'' self perception and behaviors. The groups to which people belong will therefore provide their members with the definition of who they are and how they should behave in the social sphere.Terry, D.J., Hogg, M.A. (1996).

Globally, communities interpret biological differences between men and women to create a set of social expectations that define the behaviors that are "appropriate" for men and women and determine women\u2019s and men\u2019s different access to rights, resources, power in society and even health behaviors.Galdas P.

Because of this, "power" is what determines individual attributes, behaviors, etc. and people are a part of an ontologically and epistemologically constructed set of names and labels. Such as, being female characterizes one as a woman, and being a woman signifies one as weak, emotional, and irrational, and is incapable of actions attributed to a "man". Judith Butler said gender and sex are more like verbs than nouns. She reasoned that her actions are limited. "I am not permitted to construct my gender and sex willy-nilly," she said. "[This] is so because gender is politically and therefore socially controlled. Rather than ''woman'' being something one is, it is something one does."Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. Thinking Gender. New York & London: Routledge, 1990. There are more recent criticisms of Judith Butler''s theories which critique her writing for reinforcing the very conventional dichotomies of gender.Vigo, Julian.

The beliefs, values and attitude taken up and exhibited by them is as per the agreeable norms of the society and the personal opinions of the person is not taken into the primary consideration of assignment of gender and imposition of gender roles as per the assigned gender. Intersections and crossing of the prescribed boundaries have no place in the arena of the social construct of the term "gender".The assignment of gender involves taking into account the physiological and biological attributes assigned by nature followed by the imposition of the socially constructed conduct. The social label of being classified into one or the other sex is obligatory to the medical stamp on the birth certificate. The cultural traits typically coupled to a particular sex finalize the assignment of gender and the biological differences which play a role in classifying either sex is interchangeable with the definition of gender within the social context.In this context, the socially constructed rules are at a cross road with the assignment of a particular gender to a person. Gender ambiguity deals with having the freedom to choose,manipulate and create a personal niche within any defined socially constructed code of conduct while gender fluidity is outlawing all the rules of cultural gender assignment. It does not accept the prevalence of two rigidly defined genders "Female and Male" and believes in freedom to choose any kind of gender with no rules, no defined boundaries and no fulfilling of expectations associated with any particular gender.\u0009Both these definitions are facing opposite directionalities with their own defined set of rules and criteria on which the said systems are based.\u000aSocial categories\u000aSexologist John Money coined the term gender role in 1955. "The term gender role is used to signify all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to, sexuality in the sense of eroticism."John Money, "Hermaphroditism, gender and precocity in hyperadrenocorticism: Psychologic findings'', Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital 96 (1955): 253\u2013264.\u000aElements of such a role include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations, and other factors not limited to biological sex. Because social aspects of gender can normally be presumed to be the ones of interest in sociology and closely related disciplines, gender role is often abbreviated to gender in their literature.\u000aMost societies have only two distinct, broad classes of gender roles&mdash;masculine and feminine&mdash;and these correspond with biological sexes male and female. However, some societies explicitly incorporate people who adopt the gender role opposite to their biological sex, for example the Two-Spirit people of some indigenous American peoples. Other societies include well-developed roles that are explicitly considered more or less distinct from archetypal female and male roles in those societies. In the language of the sociology of gender they comprise a third gender,Gilbert Herdt (ed.), Third Sex Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History, 1996{{cite book}}\u000amore or less distinct from biological sex (sometimes the basis for the role does include intersexuality or incorporates eunuchs).Will Roscoe, Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America, Palgrave Macmillan, 2000.

However, it may be analyzed in terms of biology \u2014 a girl must pass puberty to become a woman \u2014 and sociology, as a great deal of mature relating in social contexts is learned rather than instinctive. {{Citation needed}}Within feminist theory, terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s.

In this context, gender explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.Stephanie Garrett, Gender, (1992), p. vii. This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan; and in the work of French psychoanalysts like Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, and American feminists such as Judith Butler. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as "performative".Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, (1999), p. 9.Hurst states that some people think sex will \u201cautomatically determine one\u2019s gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one\u2019s sexual orientation (sexual attractions and behavior).\u201d[Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139-142] Gender sociologists believe that people have cultural origins and habits for dealing with gender. For example, Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriately in their designated gender in order to properly fill the role and that the way people behave as masculine or feminine interacts with social expectations. Schwalbe comments that humans "are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas".[Schwalbe, M.  The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition. 2005. 22-23] People do this through everything from clothing and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because society wants to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. They need to place people into distinct categories in order to know how we should feel about them.Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in discrimination based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system due to societal prejudices.{{Citation needed}} Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that "courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex". This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a man or woman is judged differently because he or she does not present the "correct" gender. How people present and display their gender has consequences in everyday life, but also in institutionalized aspects of our society.Recent critiques of feminist theory by Warren FarrellFarrell, W.

One of the earliest areas of interest was what is now called gender identity disorder (GID). Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by John Money, a pioneer and controversial sex and gender researcher.{{quote}}Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as "scientifically debased", because of our increased knowledge of a continuum of dimorphic features (Money''s word is "dipolar") that link biological and behavioral differences. These extend from the exclusively biological "genetic" and "prenatal hormonal" differences between men and women, to "postnatal" features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from "postpubertal hormonal" effects.Prior to recent technology that made study of brain differences possible, observable differences in behaviour between men and women could not be adequately explained solely on the basis of the limited observable physical differences between them. Hence the then-plausible theory that these differences might be explained by arbitrary cultural assignments of roles. However, Money notes concisely that masculine or feminine self-identity is now seen as essentially an expression of dimorphic brain structure (Money''s word is "coding"). The new discoveries have an additional advantage over the theory of cultural arbitrariness of gender roles, as they help explain the similarities between these roles in widely divergent culturesA Aron and LL Brown, ''Romantic Love: A Mammalian Brain System for Mate Choice,'' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences 361 (2006): 2173\u20132186.David M Buss, The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy is as Necessary as Love and Sex, (New York: Free Press, 2000{{cite book}}David M Buss, ''Human nature and culture: An evolutionary psychological perspective''.

For example, the existence of a "gay gene" has not been proven, but such a gene remains an acknowledged possibility.Michael Abrams, ''The Real Story on Gay Genes: Homing in on the science of homosexuality\u2014and sexuality itself'', Discover June (2007).\u000aGender taxonomy\u000aThe following systematic list (gender taxonomy) illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human life cycle. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research.

In sexually reproducing species, individuals produce special kinds of cells (called gametes) whose function is specifically to fuse with one unlike gamete and thereby to form a new individual. This fusion of two unlike gametes is called fertilization. By convention, where one type of gamete cell is physically larger than the other, it is associated with female sex. Thus an individual that produces exclusively large gametes (ova in humans) is said to be female, and one that produces exclusively small gametes (spermatozoa in humans) is said to be male.An individual that produces both types of gametes is called hermaphrodite (a name applicable also to people with one testis and one ovary). In some species hermaphrodites can self-fertilize (see Selfing), in others they can achieve fertilization with females, males or both. Some species, like the Japanese Ash, Fraxinus lanuginosa, only have males and hermaphrodites, a rare reproductive system called androdioecy. Gynodioecy is also found in several species. Human hermaphrodites are typically, but not always, infertile.What is considered defining of sexual reproduction is the difference between the gametes and the binary nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of gamete types within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, of more than 1.5 million living species,''RedList'', International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources official website.\u000arecorded up to about the year 2000, "no third sex cell \u2014 and so no third sex \u2014 has appeared in multicellular animals."Amanda Schaffer, Pas de Deux: Why Are There Only Two Sexes?, Slate updated 27 September 2007.Laurence D.

Sex determination in multicellular organisms and protistan mating types'', Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology 18 (2007): 348-9. Why sexual reproduction has an exclusively binary gamete system is not yet known. A few rare species that push the boundaries of the definitions are the subject of active research for light they may shed on the mechanisms of the evolution of sex. For example, the most toxic insect,Patricia J. Schmidt, Wade C. Sherbrooke, Justin O. Schmidt, ''The Detoxification of Ant (Pogonomyrmex) Venom by a Blood Factor in Horned Lizards (Phrynosoma)'', Copeia 198 (1989): 603-607. the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex, has two kinds of female and two kinds of male. One hypothesis is that the species is a hybrid, evolved from two closely related preceding species.Fossil records indicate that sexual reproduction has been occurring for at least one billion years.Leslie E. Orgel, ''The Origin of Life on the Earth'', Scientific American October, 1994.\u000aHowever, the reason for the initial evolution of sex, and the reason it has survived to the present are still matters of debate, there are many plausible theories. It appears that the ability to reproduce sexually has evolved independently in various species on many occasions. There are cases where it has also been lost, notably among the Fungi Imperfecti."Each independently lost the ability for sexual reproduction after diverging".\u000aBarbara H. Bowmana, Thomas J. Whitea and John W. Taylorb, "Human Pathogeneic Fungi and Their Close Nonpathogenic Relatives", Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 6 (1996): 89\u201396.\u000aThe blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus), flatworm (Dugesia tigrina) and some other species can reproduce either sexually or asexually depending on various conditions.H. Gee, JR Pickavance and JO Young, ''A comparative study of the population biology of the American immigrant triclad Dugesia tigrina (Girard) in two British lakes'', Hydrobiologia 361 (1977): 135-143.\u000aSexual differentiation{{See also}}\u000a\u000aAlthough sexual reproduction is defined at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate within the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called DNA that the biological processes of reproduction can "read" like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these "books", called chromosomes. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called sex chromosomes because of their role in sex determination. Ova always have the same sex chromosome, labelled X. About half of spermatozoa also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a Y chromosome. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed above.In humans, the "default" processes of reproduction result in an individual with female characteristics. An intact Y chromosome contains what is needed to "reprogram" the processes sufficiently to produce male characteristics, leading to sexual differentiation. Part of the Y chromosome, the Sex-determining Region Y (SRY), causes what would normally become ovaries to become testes. These, in turn, produce male hormones called androgens. However, several points in the processes have been identified where variations can result in people with atypical characteristics, including atypical sexual characteristics. Terminology for atypical sexual characteristics has not stabilized. Disorder of sexual development (DSD) is used by some in preference to intersex, which is used by others in preference to pseudohermaphroditism.Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is an example of a DSD that also illustrates that female development is the default for humans. Although having one X and one Y chromosome, some people are biologically insensitive to the androgens produced by their testes. As a result they follow the normal human processes which result in a person of female sex. Women who are XY report identifying as a woman \u2014 feeling and thinking like a woman \u2014 and, where their biology is completely insensitive to masculinizing factors, externally they look identical to other women. Unlike other women, however, they cannot produce ova, because they do not have ovaries.The human XY system is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system \u2014 males are ZZ and females ZW.{{Citation needed}} Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species. Several species of butterfly are known to have female parent sex determination."The speciose insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and their closest relatives, Trichoptera (caddis flies), share a female-heterogametic sex chromosome system."\u000aW. Trauta, K. Saharab, F. Marecc, "Sex Chromosomes and Sex Determination in Lepidoptera", Sexual Development 1 (2007): 332\u2013346.The platypus has a complex hybrid system, the male has ten sex chromosomes, half X and half Y.{{cite web}}\u000aGeneral studies\u000aGenes\u000aChromosomes were likened to books (above), also like books they have been studied at more detailed levels. They contain "sentences" called genes. In fact, many of these sentences are common to multiple species. Sometimes they are organized in the same order, other times they have been "edited" \u2014 deleted, copied, changed, moved, even relocated to another "book", as species evolve. Genes are a particularly important part of understanding biological processes because they are directly associated with observable objects, outside chromosomes, called proteins, whose influence on cell chemistry can be measured. In some cases genes can also be directly associated with differences clear to the naked eye, like eye-color itself. Some of these differences are sex specific, like hairy ears. The "hairy ear" gene might be found on the Y chromosomeOnline Mendelian Inheritance of Man, HAIRY EARS, Y-LINKED, although see HAIRY EARS., which explains why only men tend to have hairy ears. However, sex-limited genes on any chromosome can be expressed and "say", for example, "if you are in a male body do X, otherwise do not." The same principle explains why chimpanzees and humans are distinct, despite sharing nearly all their genes.The study of genetics is particularly inter-disciplinary. It is relevant to almost every biological science. It is investigated in detail by molecular level sciences, and itself contributes details to high level abstractions like evolutionary theory.\u000aBrains\u000a"It is well established that men have a larger cerebrum than women by about 8\u201310% (Filipek et al., 1994; Nopoulos et al.,\u000a2000; Passe et al., 1997a,b; Rabinowicz et al., 1999; Witelson et al., 1995)."Richard J Haier, Rex E Jung and others, ''The Neuroanatomy of General Intelligence: Sex Matters'', NeuroImage 25 (2005): 320\u2013327.

McDaniel, ''Big-Brained People are Smarter: A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between In Vivo Brain Volume and Intelligence'', Intelligence 33 (2005): 337\u2013346.\u000aHowever, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and "wiring", some of these differences are very pronounced. Richard J. Haier and colleagues at the universities of New Mexico and California (Irvine) found, using brain mapping, that men have more than six times the amount of grey matter related to general intelligence than women, and women have nearly ten times the amount of white matter related to intelligence than men.Richard J Haier, Rex E Jung and others, ''The Neuroanatomy of General Intelligence: Sex Matters'', NeuroImage 25 (2005): 320\u2013327.Gray matter is used for information processing, while white matter consists of the connections between processing centers. Other differences are measurable but less pronounced.Carol A. Tamminga, ''Brain Development, XI: Sexual Dimorphism'', American Journal of Psychiatry 156 (1999): 352.\u000aMost of these differences are known to be produced by the activity of hormones, hence ultimately derived from the Y chromosome and sexual differentiation. However, differences arising from the activity of genes directly have also been observed.\u000a{{quote}}It has also been demonstrated that brain processing responds to the external environment. Learning, both of ideas and behaviors, appears to be coded in brain processes. It also appears that in several simplified cases this coding operates differently, but in some ways equivalently, in the brains of men and women."Even when men and women do the same chores equally well, they may use different brain circuits to get the same result." Linda Marsha, ''He Thinks, She Thinks'', Discover July (2007). For example, both men and women learn and use language; however, bio-chemically, they appear to process it differently. Differences in female and male use of language are likely reflections both of biological preferences and aptitudes, and of learned patterns.Two of the main fields that study brain structure, biological (and other) causes and behavioral (and other) results are brain neurology and biological psychology. Cognitive science is another important discipline in the field of brain research.\u000aSociety and behaviorsMany of the more complicated human behaviors are influenced by both innate factors and by environmental ones, which include everything from genes, gene expression, and body chemistry, through diet and social pressures. A large area of research in behavioral psychology collates evidence in an effort to discover correlations between behavior and various possible antecedents such as genetics, gene regulation, access to food and vitamins, culture, gender, hormones, physical and social development, and physical and social environments.A core research area within sociology is the way human behavior operates on itself, in other words, how the behavior of one group or individual influences the behavior of other groups or individuals. Starting in the late 20th century, the feminist movement has contributed extensive study of gender and theories about it, notably within sociology but not restricted to it.\u000aSocial theorists have sought to determine the specific nature of gender in relation to biological sex and sexuality,{{Citation needed}} with the result being that culturally established gender and sex have become interchangeable identifications which signify the allocation of a specific ''biological'' sex within a categorical gender.{{Citation needed}} The second wave feminist view that gender is socially constructed and hegemonic in all societies, remains current in some literary theoretical circles, Kira Hall and Mary Bucholtz publishing new perspectives as recently as 2008.{{cite book}}Contemporary socialisation theory proposes the notion that when a child is first born it has a biological sex but no social gender.{{Citation needed}} As the child grows, "society provides a string of prescriptions, templates, or models of behaviors appropriate to the one sex or the other"Connell, R 1987, Gender & Power, Polity Press, Cambridge. which socialises the child into belonging to a culturally specific gender.{{Citation needed}} There is huge incentive for a child to concede to their socialisation{{Citation needed}} with gender shaping the individual\u2019s opportunities for education, work, family, sexuality, reproduction, authority,{{Citation needed}} and to make an impact on the production of culture and knowledge.Lorber, J & Farrell, S (eds.) 1991, The Social Construction of Gender, Sage, Newbury Park.

Conversational theorists, for example, have studied   the way in which interruptions, turn taking and the setting of topics re-create gender inequality in the flow of ordinary talk\u000aThe way in which the preceding three processes help to produce gendered components of individual identity. i.e. the   way in which they create and maintain an image of a gendered self\u000aGender is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualising social structures.\u000a\u000aLooking at gender through a Foucauldian lens, gender is transfigured into a vehicle for the social division of power.{{Citation needed}} Gender difference is merely a construct of society used to enforce the distinctions made between that which is assumed to be female and male,{{Citation needed}} and allow for the domination of masculinity over femininity through the attribution of specific gender-related characteristics.{{Citation needed}} "The idea that men and women are more different from one another than either is from anything else, must come from something other than nature\u2026 far from being an expression of natural differences, exclusive gender identity is the suppression of natural similarities."Glover & Kaplan, 2000, p. xxi.Gender conventions play a large role in attributing masculine and feminine characteristics to a fundamental biological sex.{{Citation needed}} Socio-cultural codes and conventions, the rules by which society functions, and which are both a creation of society as well as a constituting element of it, determine the allocation of these specific traits to the sexes. These traits provide the foundations for the creation of hegemonic gender difference. It follows then, that gender can be assumed as the acquisition and internalisation of social norms. Individuals are therefore socialised through their receipt of society\u2019s expectations of \u2018acceptable\u2019 gender attributes which are flaunted within institutions such as the family, the state and the media. Such a notion of \u2018gender\u2019 then becomes naturalised into a person\u2019s sense of self or identity, effectively imposing a gendered social category upon a sexed body.Glover, D & Kaplan, C 2000, Genders, Routledge, New York.The conception that people are gendered rather than sexed also coincides with Judith Butler\u2019s theories of gender performativity. Butler argues that gender is not an expression of what one is, but rather something that one does.Lloyd, M 1999, \u2018Performativity, Parody, Politics\u2019 in CULT 19016 Contemporary Modes of Culture Resource Materials, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton. It follows then, that if gender is acted out in a repetitive manner it is in fact re-creating and effectively embedding itself within the social consciousness. Contemporary sociological reference to male and female gender roles typically uses masculinities and femininities in the plural rather than singular, suggesting diversity both within cultures as well as across them.From the ''evidence'', it can only be concluded that gender is socially constructed and each individual is unique in their gender characteristics, regardless of which biological sex they are as every child is socialised to behave a certain way and have the \u2018proper\u2019 gender attributes. If individuals in society do not conform to this pressure, they are destined to be treated as abnormal; therefore it is personally greatly beneficial for them to cooperate in the determined \u2018correct\u2019 ordering of the world. In fact, the very construct of society is a product of and produces gender norms. There is bias in applying the word \u2018gender\u2019 to anyone in a finite way; rather each person is endowed with certain gender characteristics. The world cannot be egalitarian while there are \u2018assigned\u2019 genders and individuals are not given the right to express any gender characteristic they desire.The difference between the sociological and popular definitions of gender involve a different dichotomy and focus. For example the sociological approach to "gender" (social roles: female versus male) will focus on the difference in (economic/ power) position between a male CEO (disregarding the fact that he is heterosexual or homosexual) to female workers in his employ (disregarding whether they are straight or gay). However the popular sexual self-conception approach (self-conception: gay versus straight) will focus on the different self-conceptions and social conceptions of those who are gay/straight, in comparison with those who are straight (disregarding what might be vastly differing economic and power positions between female and male groups in each category). There is then, in relation to definition of and approaches to "gender", a tension between historic feminist sociology and contemporary homosexual sociology.See for example http://www.jstor.org/pss/201865\u000aLegal statusA person''s sex as male or female has legal significance \u2014 sex is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for men and women. Many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women. Marriage is usually only available to opposite-sex couples.The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is female or male. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for intersexual or transgender people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate \u2014 technically, however, this is not a change of status per se. Rather, it is recognition of a status which was deemed to exist, but unknown, from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgendered people.Gender assignment, when there are indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by a single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female gonads could be recognized as female at birth.The ability to change legal gender for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, transsexual people could be recognized as having the genders they identified with under many areas of the law, including social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period, it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law.The first person of "neutral" gender (that is, neither man or woman in legal terms) is Norrie May-Welby, from Australia, whose status was set on March, 2010.\u000aGender and developmentGender, and particularly the role of women is widely recognized as vitally important to international development issues.{{Citation needed}} This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring participation, but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.{{Citation needed}}Researchers at theOverseas Development Institute have highlighted that policy dialogue on the Millennium Development Goals needs to recognise that the gender dynamics of power, poverty, vulnerability and care link all the goals.{{citeweb}} Gender explicit issues are only explicit in MDG 3 and 5, however gender impacts all the goalsRebecca Holmes, Nicola Jones, and Jessica Espey (2010) The MDGs and gender Overseas Development Institute:\u000a\u000aDiscriminatory laws can limit women&#39;s access to education and ownership\u000aWomen make up the majority of those working in agriculture or in insecure employment\u000aWomen&#39;s dual responsibilities as carers and income earners leaves them suffering from time poverty and thus unable to access health and education services\u000aRole as carers particularly impacts MDG4 on child mortality\u000aGender-based discrimination particularly affects MDG8 (Partnerships for Development).\u000a\u000aAs well as directly addressing inequality, attention to gender issues is regarded as important to the success of development programs, for all participants.{{Citation needed}} For example, in microfinance it is common to target women, as besides the fact that women tend to be over-represented in the poorest segments of the population, they are also regarded as more reliable at repaying the loans.{{Citation needed}}Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted in November 2009 a 10-year strategic framework that includes the strategic objective of gender equity in access to resources, goods, services and decision-making in rural areas, and mainstreams gender equity in all FAO''s programmes for agriculture and rural development.{{citeweb}} The Association for Progressive Communications (APC) has developed a Gender Evaluation Methodology for planning and evaluating development projects to ensure they benefit all sectors of society including women.http://www.genderevaluation.net Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM)The Gender-related Development Index (GDI), developed by the United Nations (UN), aims to show the inequalities between men and women in the following areas: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.\u000aGender and povertyGender inequality has a great impact especially on women and poverty. In poverty stricken countries it is more likely that men have more opportunities to have an income, have more political and social rights than women. Women experience more poverty than men do due to gender discrimination.Gender and Development (GAD) is a holistic approach to give aid to countries where gender inequality has a great effect of not improving the social and economic development. It is to empower women and decrease the level of inequality between men and women.Chant. S. 2008.

However, Judaism traditionally holds that God is completely non-corporeal, and thus neither male nor female. Conceptions of the gender of God notwithstanding, traditional Judaism places a strong emphasis on individuals following traditional gender roles, though many modern denominations of Judaism strive for greater egalitarianism.In Christianity, God is described in masculine terms and the Church has historically been described in feminine terms.  On the other hand, Christian theology in many churches distinguishes between the masculine images used of God (Father, King, God the Son) and the reality they signify, which transcends gender, embodies all the virtues of both genders perfectly, and is the creator of both human sexes. In the New Testament, the Holy Spirit is treated with the neuter pronoun. Hebrew speaking Christians like the Ebionites used the female gender for the Holy Spirit.In Hinduism{{quote}}\u000aOther usesThe word gender is used in several contexts to describe binary differences, more or less loosely associated by analogy with various actual or perceived differences between men and women.\u000aLinguistics{{Main}}\u000aNatural languages often make gender distinctions. These may be of various kinds.\u000a\u000aGrammatical gender is a property of some languages in which every noun is assigned a gender, often with no direct relation to its meaning. For example, the word for &#34;girl&#34; is muchacha (grammatically feminine) in Spanish, M\u00e4dchen (grammatically neuter) in German, and cail\u00edn (grammatically masculine) in Irish.\u000aThe term \u201cgrammatical gender\u201d is often applied to more complex noun class systems. This is especially true when a noun class system includes masculine and feminine as well as some other non-gender features like animate, edible, manufactured, and so forth. An example of the latter is found in the Dyirbal language. A system traditionally called \u201cgender\u201d is found in the Ojibwe language which distinguishes between animate and inanimate, but since this does not exhibit a masculine/feminine distinction it might be better described by \u201cnoun class\u201d. Likewise, Sumerian distinguishes between personal (human and divine) and impersonal (all other) noun classes, but these classes have traditionally been known as genders.\u000aSeveral languages attest the use of different vocabulary by men and women, to differing degrees. See, for instance, Gender differences in spoken Japanese. The oldest documented language, Sumerian, records a distinctive sub-language only used by female speakers. Conversely, many Indigenous Australian languages have distinctive registers with limited lexis used by men in the presence of their mothers-in-law (see Avoidance speech).\u000aMost languages include terms that are used asymmetrically in reference to men and women. Concern that current language may be biased in favor of men has led some authors in recent times to argue for the use of a more Gender-neutral vocabulary in English and other languages.\u000a\u000a\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aAndrocentrism\u000aAndrogyny\u000aBiological determinism\u000aEpicene\u000aFemininity\u000aGender bender\u000aGender differences\u000aGender equality\u000aGender identity\u000aGender inequality\u000aGender role\u000aGynocentrism\u000aMasculinity\u000aMisandry\u000aMisogyny\u000aPostgenderism\u000aSexism\u000aSexual identity\u000aTransgender\u000a\u000a\u000aBooks\u000a\u000a Brain Sex, Anne Moir and David Jessel, 1989.\u000a The Female Brain, Louann Brizendine, 2006.\u000a\u000a\u000aLists\u000a\u000aList of animal names \u2014 Animal: female, male; horse: mare, stallion; human: woman, man; etc..\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences\u000aFootnotes{{Reflist}}\u000aNotations\u000a\u000aGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(59,0,'{{Very long}}\u000a{{pp-move-indef}}\u000a{{Rights}}\u000aHuman rights are "rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled."Houghton Mifflin Company (2006) Proponents of the concept usually assert that everyone is endowed with certain entitlements merely by reason of being human.{{Cite book}}lHuman rights are thus conceived in a universalist and egalitarian fashion. Such entitlements can exist as shared norms of actual human moralities, as justified moral norms or natural rights supported by strong reasons, or as legal rights either at a national level or within international law.{{Cite web}}\u000aHowever, there is no consensus as to precise nature of what in particular should or should not be regarded as a human right in any of the preceding senses, and the abstract concept of human rights has been a subject of intense philosophical debate and criticism.The modern conception of human rights developed in the aftermath of the Second World War, in part as a response to the Holocaust, culminating in the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. However, while the phrase "human rights" is relatively modern the intellectual foundations of the modern concept can be traced through the history of philosophy and the concepts of natural law rights and liberties as far back as the city states of Classical Greece and the development of Roman Law. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the enlightenment concept of natural rights developed by figures such as John Locke and Immanuel Kant and through the political realm in the United States Bill of Rights and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.{{cquote}}\u000aHistory{{Main}}\u000aAlthough ideas of rights and liberty have existed for much of human history, it is unclear to what degree such concepts can be described as "human rights" in the modern sense. The concept of rights certainly existed in pre-modern cultures; ancient philosophers such as Aristotle wrote extensively on the rights (to dikaion in ancient Greek, roughly a "just claim") of citizens to property and participation in public affairs. However, neither the Greeks nor the Romans had any concept of universal human rights; slavery, for instance, was justified both in ancient and modern times as a natural condition.{{cite book}} Medieval charters of liberty such as the English Magna Carta were not charters of human rights, let alone general charters of rights. They instead constituted a form of limited political and legal agreement to address specific political circumstances, in the case of Magna Carta later being mythologised in the course of early modern debates about rights.Freeman,The Magna Carta was very important in the late middle ages.  pp. 18-19The basis of most modern legal interpretations of human rights can be traced back to relatively recent European history. The Twelve Articles of the Black Forest (1525) are considered to be the first record of human rights in Europe. They were part of the peasants'' demands raised towards the Swabian League in the Peasants'' War in Germany. In Britain in 1689 the English Bill of Rights (or \u201cAn Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown\u201d) and the Scottish Claim of Right each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions. Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively, both of which established certain legal rights. Additionally, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 encoded a number of fundamental  civil rights and civil freedoms into law.{{Cquote}}These were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill and G. W. F. Hegel during the 18th and 19th centuries.  The term human rights probably came into use sometime between Paine''s The Rights of Man and William Lloyd Garrison''s 1831 writings in The Liberator saying he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights"Mayer (2000) p. 110In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of slavery. A number of reformers such as William Wilberforce in Britain, worked towards the abolition of slavery. This was achieved in the British Empire by the Slave Trade Act 1807 and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. In the United States, many northern states abolished their institution of slavery by the mid 19th century, although southern states were still very much economically dependent on slave labour. Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories culminated in the southern states'' secession and the American Civil War. During the reconstruction period immediately following the war, several amendments to the United States Constitution were made. These included the 13th amendment, banning slavery, 14th amendment, assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the 15th amendment, guaranteeing African Americans the right to vote.Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In Western Europe and North America, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour. The women''s rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote. National liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers. One of the most influential was Mahatma Gandhi''s movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the African American Civil Rights Movement, and more recent diverse identity politics movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.The establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the 1864 Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in 1864 laid the foundations of International humanitarian law, to be further developed following the two World Wars.The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them were a driving force behind the development of modern human rights instruments. The League of Nations was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I. The League''s goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.At the 1945 Yalta Conference, the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League''s role. This body was to be the United Nations. The United Nations has played an important role in international human rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law which now make up international humanitarian law and international human rights law.\u000aInternational  law{{Main}}\u000aModern international conceptions of human rights can be traced to the aftermath of World War II and the foundation of the United Nations. Article 1(3) of the United Nations charter set out one of the purposes of the UN is to:  "[t]o achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion".http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/chapter1.html United Nations Charter Article 1(3) The rights espoused in the UN charter would be codified in the International Bill of Human Rights, composing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\u000aUniversal Declaration of Human Rights{{Main}}\u000a\u000aThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly(A/RES/217, 1948-12-10 at Palais de Chaillot, Paris) in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of World War II. Although the UDHR was a non-binding resolution, it is now considered to have acquired the force of international customary law which may be invoked under appropriate circumstances by national and other judiciaries.Ball, Gready The UDHR urges member nations to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the "foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behaviour of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the rights-duty duality.{{Cquote}}The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt as Chair, who began to discuss an International Bill of Rights in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.{{cite journal}} Canadian law professor John Humphrey and French lawyer Ren\u00e9 Cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. The final three articles place, according to Cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized. Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:{{Cquote}}Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi.Glendon (2001)Asia Times Online The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rightsBall, Gready (2007) p.34 was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. This principle was not then opposed by any member states (the declaration was adopted unanimously, with the abstention of the Eastern Bloc, Apartheid South Africa and Saudi Arabia), however this principle was later subject to significant challenges.The Universal Declaration was bifurcated into two distinct and different covenants, a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and a second Covenant on social, economic, and cultural rights due to questions about the relevance and propriety of economic and social provisions in covenants on human rights.  Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources. This debate over whether human rights are more fundamental than economic has continued to this day. Louis Henkin, The International Bill of Rights: The Universal Declaration and the Covenants, in International Enforcement of Human Rights 6-9, Bernhardt and Jolowicz, eds, (1987))The drafters of the Covenants initially intended only one instrument. The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed.  The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants.  The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human right which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources.  In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognised depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights.  There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socio-economic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.Louis Henkin, Introduction, The International Bill of Rights 9-10 (1981).This debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human rights law led to the two covenants.  The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called Unity Resolution.  The two covenants allowed states to adopt some rights and derogate others.{{Citation needed}} Those in favor of having economic and social rights included with basic human rights could not gain sufficient consensus, despite their belief that all categories of rights should be linked.Ball, Gready (2007) p.35{{cite journal}}{{Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}\u000aTreatiesIn 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) were adopted by the United Nations, between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human rights law.Since then numerous other treaties (pieces of legislation) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as human rights instruments. Some of the most significant, referred to (with ICCPR and ICESCR) as "the seven core treaties", are:\u000a\u000aConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969) http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm\u000aConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) (entry into force: 1981) http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/index.html\u000aUnited Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT) (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1984) http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm\u000aConvention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989) http://www.unicef.org/crc\u000aConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) (adopted 2006, entry into force: 2008) http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml\u000aInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (ICRMW or more often MWC) (adopted 1990, entry into force: 2003)\u000a\u000a\u000aHumanitarian Law\u000a{{Main}}\u000a{{Main}}The Geneva Conventions came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in armed conflict, and build on the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, the international community''s first attempt to formalize the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.\u000aUniversal Jurisdiction{{Main}}\u000aUniversal jurisdiction is a controversial principle in international law whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting country. The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish. The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens.{{cite journal}}\u000aInternational organizations\u000aUnited Nations{{Main}}\u000aThe United Nations (UN) is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international jurisdiction for universal human rights legislation.Ball, Gready (2007) p.92 Human rights are primarily governed by the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council, and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties.

The UN Charter gives the Security Council the power to:\u000a\u000aInvestigate any situation threatening international peace;\u000aRecommend procedures for peaceful resolution of a dispute;\u000aCall upon other member nations to completely or partially interrupt economic relations as well as sea, air, postal, and radio communications, or to sever diplomatic relations; and\u000aEnforce its decisions militarily if necessary.\u000a\u000aThe Security Council hears reports from all organs of the United Nations, and can take action over any issue which it feels threatens peace and security, including human rights issues.

The degree of unanimity over these conventions, in terms of how many and which countries have ratified them varies, as does the degree to which they are respected by various states. The UN has set up a number of treaty-based bodies to monitor and study human rights, to be supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR).

The intention to draw up the African Charter on Human and Peoples'' Rights was announced in 1979 and the Charter was unanimously approved at the OAU''s 1981 Assembly. Pursuant to its Article 63 (whereby it was to "come into force three months after the reception by the Secretary General of the instruments of ratification or adherence of a simple majority" of the OAU''s member states), the African Charter on Human and Peoples'' Rights came into effect on 21 October 1986 \u2013 in honour of which 21st of October was declared "African Human Rights Day".African Charter on Human and Peoples'' RightsThe African Commission on Human and Peoples'' Rights (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the African Union tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples'') rights throughout the African continent as well as interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples'' Rights and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter.

However, Australia has been criticised at various times for its immigration policies, treatment of asylum seekers, treatment of its indigenous population, and foreign policy.{{Oceania topic}}\u000aPhilosophiesSeveral theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights become part of social expectations.One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds.Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with Hume). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) - a social contract.\u000aNatural rights{{Main}}Natural law theories base human rights on a \u201cnatural\u201d moral, religious or even biological order that is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.Socrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (dikaion physikon, \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, Latin ius naturale).  Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,Shellens (1959) although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work by Thomas Aquinas.Jaffa (1979)The development of this tradition of natural justice into one of natural law is usually attributed to the Stoics.Sills (1968, 1972) Natural LawSome of the early Church Fathers sought to incorporate the until then pagan concept of natural law into Christianity. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Francisco Su\u00e1rez, Richard Hooker, Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, and John Locke.In the Seventeenth century Thomas Hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). The natural law was how a rational human, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. It was discovered by considering humankind''s natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law.  In Hobbes'' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.Hugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs." (De iure belli ac pacis, Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus (non esse Deum), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in Two Treatises of Government. Locke turned Hobbes'' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.The Belgian philosopher of law Frank Van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception{{cite web}} of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.Kohen (2007)The term "human rights" has replaced the term "natural rights" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring natural law for their existence.{{cite web}}\u000aSocial contractThe English philosopher Thomas Hobbes suggested the existence of a hypothetical social contract where a group of free individuals agree for the sake of the common good to form institutions to govern themselves. They give up some liberties in exchange for protection from the Sovereign. This led to John Locke''s theory that a failure of the government to secure rights is a failure which justifies the removal of the government, and was mirrored in later postulation by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his "Du Contrat Social" (The Social Contract).International equity expert Paul Finn has echoed this view:{{cquote}}The relationship between government and the governed in countries which follow the English law tradition is a fiduciary one. In equity law, a politician''s fiduciary obligations are not only the duties of good faith and loyalty, but also include duties of skill and competence in managing a country and its people. Originating from within the Courts of Equity, the fiduciary concept exists to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority. The fiduciary relationship between government and the governed arises from the governments ability to control people with the exercise of its power. In effect, if a government has the power to abolish any rights, it is equally burdened with the fiduciary duty to protect such an interest because it would benefit from the exercise of its own discretion to extinguish rights which it alone had the power to dispose of.Salevao (2005) p.76\u000aReciprocityThe Golden Rule, or the ethic of reciprocity states that one must do unto others as one would be treated themselves; the principle being that reciprocal recognition and respect of rights ensures that one''s own rights will be protected. This principle can be found in all the world''s major religions in only slightly differing forms, and was enshrined in the "Declaration Toward a Global Ethic" by the Parliament of the World''s Religions in 1993.\u000aSoviet concept of human rights{{Main}}Soviet concept of human rights was different from conceptions prevalent in the West. According to Western legal theory, "it is the individual who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted against the government", whereas Soviet law declared that state is the source of human rightsLambelet, Doriane.

According to Vladimir Lenin, the purpose of socialist courts was "not to eliminate terror ... but to substantiate it and legitimize in principle" .Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society.

Martin Latsis, chief of the Ukrainian Cheka explained: "Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the Red Terror."Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia &ndash; Past, Present, and Future, 1994. ISBN 0-374-52738-5.The purpose of public trials was "not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime &ndash; that was predetermined by the appropriate party authorities &ndash; but to provide yet another forum for political agitation and propaganda for the instruction of the citizenry (see Moscow Trials for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be party members, were required to take their client''s guilt for granted..."\u000aOther theories of human rightsThe philosopher John Finnis argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.{{cite web}}Finnis (1980) Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:{{cquote}}The biological theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and altruism in the context of natural selection.Arnhart (1998)Clayton, Schloss (2004)Paul, Miller, Paul (2001): Arnhart, Larry.

A recent critique has been advanced by Charles Blattberg in his essay "The Ironic Tragedy of Human Rights." Blattberg argues that rights talk, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to assert.Social Science Research Network (SSRN) In his book After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre claimed the concept that all human beings have certain rights simply by virtue of being human was illogical, stated "the best reason for asserting so bluntly that there are no such rights is indeed of precisely the same type as the best reason which we possess for asserting that there are no witches and the best reason which we possess for asserting that there are no unicorns: every attempt to give good reasons for believing there are such rights has failed."McIntyre, Alisdair "After Virtue" p. 69 Duckworth 1981\u000aMarxist Critique of Human RightsIn On the Jewish Question, Karl Marx criticized Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as bourgeois ideology:\u000a\u000aAbove all, we note the fact that the so-called rights of man, the droits de l''homme as distinct from the droits du citoyen, are nothing but the rights of a member of civil society -- i.e., the rights of egoistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community. ...  according to the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1791:\u000a"Liberty consists in being able to do everything which does not harm others."\u000aLiberty, therefore, is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law, just as the boundary between two fields is determined by a boundary post.\u000aand that:\u000a\u000aSecurity is the supreme social concept of bourgeois society, the concept of the police, the whole society exists only to ensure each of its members the preservation of his person, his rights and his property.\u000a\u000aThus for Marx, liberal rights and ideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs protection from other human beings. Therefore liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility \u2014 according to Marx, the fact \u2014 that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found in human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime of rights encourages us to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.Marxist critical theorist Slavoj \u017di\u017eek argued that: "liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space\u2014in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be \u2018harassed\u2019, that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others." and "universal human rights are effectively the right of white, male property-owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, and exert political domination."http://libcom.org/library/against-human-rights-zizek\u000aConcepts in human rights\u000aIndivisibility and categorizationThe most common categorization of human rights is to split them into civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).\u000aIndivisibilityThe UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:{{cquote}}This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the full belly thesis).The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action:{{cquote}} This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).Although accepted by the signatories to the UDHR, most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. For example, in the United States there is no universal access to healthcare free at the point of use.Light (2002) That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely (the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this). Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.\u000aCategorizationOpponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches. Economic, social and cultural rights are argued to be:Scott (1989\u000a\u000apositive, meaning that they require active provision of entitlements by the state (as opposed to the state being required only to prevent the breach of rights)\u000aresource-intensive, meaning that they are expensive and difficult to provide\u000aprogressive, meaning that they will take significant time to implement\u000avague, meaning they cannot be quantitatively measured, and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge\u000aideologically divisive/political, meaning that there is no consensus on what should and shouldn&#39;t be provided as a right\u000asocialist, as opposed to capitalist\u000anon-justiciable, meaning that their provision, or the breach of them, cannot be judged in a court of law\u000aaspirations or goals, as opposed to real &#39;legal&#39; rights\u000a\u000aSimilarly civil and political rights are categorized as:\u000a\u000anegative, meaning the state can protect them simply by taking no action\u000acost-free\u000aimmediate, meaning they can be immediately provided if the state decides to\u000aprecise, meaning their provision is easy to judge and measure\u000anon-ideological/non-political\u000acapitalist\u000ajusticiable\u000areal ''legal'' rights\u000a\u000aIn The No-Nonsense Guide to Human Rights Olivia Ball and Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorisation. Amongst several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real ''legal'' right.Ball, Gready (2007) p.37Another categorization, offered by Karel Vasak, is that there are three generations of human rights: first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. Human rights expert Philip Alston argues:{{cquote}}He, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:{{cquote}}{{cquote}}Some human rights are said to be "inalienable rights."  The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."\u000aUniversalism vs. cultural relativism{{Main}}\u000aThe UDHR enshrines universal rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to.Proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights.For example female genital mutilation occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America. It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women''s and girl''s rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.Universalism has been described by some as cultural, economic or political imperialism. In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.For example, in 1981, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.Littman (1999) The former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, and of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad both claimed in the 1990s that Asian values were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. This view is countered by Mahathir''s former deputy:{{cquote}}and also by Singapore''s opposition leader Chee Soon Juan who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.Ball, Gready (2007) p.25{{cite book}}An appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers, such as John Locke and John Stuart Mill, have all been Western and indeed that some were involved in the running of Empires themselves.Tunick (2006)Beate (2005)Cultural relativism is a self-detonating position; if cultural relativism is true, then universalism must also be true. Relativistic arguments also tend to neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They also don''t account for the fact that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.Michael Ignatieff has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.Ignatief, M. (2001) p.68 This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the international community''s adherence to this principle:{{cquote}}\u000aState and non-state actorsCompanies, NGOs, political parties, informal groups, and individuals are known as non-State actors. Non-State actors can also commit human rights abuses, but are not generally subject to human rights law other than under International Humanitarian Law, which applies to individuals.{{Citation needed}} Also, certain national instruments such as the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK), impose human rights obligations on certain entities which are not traditionally considered as part of government ("public authorities").{{Citation needed}}Multinational companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses.{{cite web}} Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined.{{Citation needed}} Multinational companies'' primary responsibility is to their shareholders, not to those affected by their actions. Such companies may be larger than the economies of some the states within which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable. Jean Ziegler, Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on the right to food stated in a report in 2003:{{cquote}}In August 2003 the Human Rights Commission''s Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights.{{cite web}} These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored.{{cite web}}\u000aTheory of value and property{{See also}}\u000aHenry of Ghent articulated the theory that every person has a property interest in their own body.Tierney (1997) John Locke uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.John Locke In addition, property precedes government and government cannot "dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily." To deny valid property rights according to Locke is to deny human rights. The British philosopher had significant impacts upon the development of the Government of the UK and was central to the fundamental founding philosophy of the United States. Karl Marx later critiqued Locke''s theory of property in his Theories of Surplus Value, seeing the beginnings of a theory of surplus value in Locke''s works. In Locke''s Second Treatise he argued that the right to own private property was unlimited as long as nobody took more than they could use without allowing any of their property to go to waste and that there were enough common resources of comparable quality available for others to create their own property. Locke did believe that some would be more "industrious and rational" than others and would amass more property, but believed this would not cause shortages. Though this system could work before the introduction of money, Marx argued in Theories of Surplus Value that Locke''s system would break down and claimed money was a contradiction of the law of nature on which private property was founded.Vaughn (1978)\u000aLegal issues\u000aHuman rights vs. national security{{See also}}With the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable{{cite web}}), the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency - although{{cquote}}Rights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as peremptory norms or jus cogens. Such United Nations Charter obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.Examples of national security being used to justify human rights violations include the Japanese American internment during World War II,Children of the Camps | Internment Timeline Stalin''s Great Purge,The Great Purge and the actual and alleged modern-day abuses of terror suspects rights by some western countries, often in the name of the War on Terror.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}\u000aHuman rights violations\u000a{{See also}}Human rights violations occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any part of the UDHR treaty or other international human rights or humanitarian law. In regard to human rights violations of United Nations laws. Article 39 of the United Nations Charter designates the UN Security Council (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent non-governmental organizations, such as Amnesty International, International Federation of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, World Organisation Against Torture, Freedom House, International Freedom of Expression Exchange and Anti-Slavery International. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of alleged human rights abuses and apply pressure to enforce human rights laws.Only a very few countries do not commit significant human rights violations, according to Amnesty International. In their 2004 human rights report (covering 2003), the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Costa Rica are the only (mappable) countries that did not (in the opinion of Amnesty International) violate at least some human rights significantly.{{cite book}}There are a wide variety of databases available which attempt to measure, in a rigorous fashion, exactly what violations governments commit against those within their territorial jurisdiction.{{Citation needed}}  An example of this is the list created and maintained by Prof. Christian Davenport at the Kroc Institute - University of Notre Dame.{{cite web}}Wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, are breaches of International humanitarian law and represent the most serious of human rights violations.When a government closes a geographical region to journalists, it raises suspicions of human rights violations.  Seven regions are currently closed to foreign journalists:\u000a\u000aChechnya, Russia http://www.medialaw.ru/e_pages/research/commentary6.htm\u000aMyanmar (Burma)\u000aNorth Korea\u000aPapua, Indonesia http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2007/07/05/indone16272.htm\u000aPeshawar, Pakistan http://www.mcclatchydc.com/world/story/30964.html\u000aTibet, People&#39;s Republic of China http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&sid=1208395\u000aJaffna Peninsula, Srilanka http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/sri-lanka\u000a\u000a{{International Criminal Law}}\u000aCurrently debated rightsEvents and new possibilities can affect existing rights or require new ones.  Advances of technology, medicine, and philosophy constantly challenge the status quo of human rights thinking.\u000aEnvironmental rightsThere are two not basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system. The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 21 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples'' Rights, and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the American Charter of Human Rights).African Commission on Human and Peoples'' RightsOAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development. The second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually - the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.The onset of various environmental issues, especially climate change, has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these. Such as the conflict between right to decide number of offspring and the common need for a healthy environment, as noted in the tragedy of the commons.Garrett Hardin, "The Tragedy of the Commons", Science, Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243-1248. Also available here and here. In the area of environmental rights, the responsibilities of multinational corporations, so far relatively unaddressed by human rights legislation, is of paramount consideration.{{Citation needed}}Environmental Rights revolve largely around the idea of a right to a livable environment both for the present and the future generations.\u000aFuture generationsIn 1997 UNESCO adopted the Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation. The Declaration opens with the words:{{cquote}}Article 1 of the declaration states "the present generations have the responsibility of ensuring that the needs and interests of present and future generations are fully safeguarded." The preamble to the declaration states that "at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its environment are threatened" and the declaration covers a variety of issues including protection of the environment, the human genome, biodiversity, cultural heritage, peace, development, and education. The preamble recalls that the responsibilities of the present generations towards future generations has been referred to in various international instruments, including the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO 1972), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992), the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (World Conference on Human Rights, 1993) and a number of UN General Assembly resolutions relating to the protection of the global climate for present and future generations adopted since 1990.Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation\u000aLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) rights{{Main}}\u000aLGBT rights are rights that relate to sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.In 77 countries, homosexuality remains a criminal offense, punishable by execution in seven countries.http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/1111 The decriminalization of private, consensual, adult sexual relations, especially in countries where corporal or capital punishment is involved, remains one of the primary concerns of LGBT human rights advocates.http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/takeaction/partners/22.html"security and privacy by criminalizing harmless private relations between consenting adults"\u000aOther issues include but are not limited to: government recognition of same-sex relationships, LGBT adoption, sexual orientation and military service, immigration equality, anti-discrimination laws, hate crime laws regarding violence against LGBT people, sodomy laws, anti-lesbianism  laws, and equal age of consent for same-sex activity.http://www.amnestyusa.org/lgbt-human-rights/country-information/page.do?id=1106576http://www.amnestyusa.org/lgbt-human-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights/page.do?id=1106573http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/lgbt.pdf.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}A global charter for LGBT rights has been proposed in the form of the ''Yogyakarta Principles'', a set of 29 principles whose authors'' say apply International Human Rights Law statutes and precedent to situations relevant to LGBT people''s experience.http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/ The principles were presented at a United Nations event in New York on November 7, 2007, co-sponsored by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.The principles have been acknowledged with influencing the French proposed UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, which focuses on ending violence, criminalization and capital punishment and does not include dialogue about same-sex marriage or right to start a family.http://www.franceonu.org/spip.php?article4092http://www.netherlandsmission.org/article.asp?articleref=AR00000530EN The proposal was supported by 67 of the United Nations'' 192 member countries, including all EU nations and the United States. An alternative statement opposing the proposal was initiated by Syria and signed by 57 member nations, including all 27 nations of the Arab League as well as Iran and North Korea.http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4BH7EW20081218http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/world/19nations.html?_r=1\u000aTradeAlthough both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasize the importance of a right to work, neither of these documents explicitly mention trade as a mechanism for ensuring this fundamental right. And yet trade plays a key role in providing jobs.{{cite web}}Some experts argue that trade is inherent to human nature and that when governments inhibit international trade they directly inhibit the right to work and the other indirect benefits, like the right to education, that increased work and investment help accrue.{{cite web}} Others have argued that the ability to trade does not affect everyone equally\u2014often groups like the rural poor, indigenous groups and women are less likely to access the benefits of increased trade.{{cite web}}On the other hand, others think that it is no longer primarily individuals but companies that trade, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed as a human right.{{Citation needed}} Additionally, trying to fit too many concepts under the umbrella of what qualifies as a human right has the potential to dilute their importance. Finally, it is difficult to define a right to trade as either "fair"{{cite web}} or "just" in that all trade regimes create winners and losers, and changing the rules only creates different losers, not necessarily fewer.{{cite web}}\u000a\u000aSee also: The Recognition of Labour Standards within the World Trade Organisation and Investor state dispute settlement\u000aWater{{See also}}There is no current universal human right to water, binding or not, enshrined by the United Nations or any other multilateral body. In November 2002, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a non-binding comment affirming that access to water was a human right:{{cquote}}This principle was reaffirmed at the 3rd and 4th World Water Councils in 2003 and 2006. This marks a departure from the conclusions of the 2nd World Water Forum in The Hague in 2000, which stated that water was a commodity to be bought and sold, not a right.{{cite web}} There are calls from many NGOs and politicians to enshrine access to water as a binding human right, and not as a commodity.{{cite web}}\u000aCrime and PunishmentThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the "right to life".Universal Declaration of Human Rights - Article 5 According to many Human Rights activists, the death penalty violates these rights.Amnesty International The United Nations also called on retentionist states to establish a moratorium on Capital Punishment with a view to abolition.United Nations resolution 62/149 States which do not face considerable moral and political pressure. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights also prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. Countries have argued that "enhanced interrogation methods", which amount to torture, are needed for national security. Human rights activists have also criticized some methods used to punish criminal offenders. For example, Corporal Punishment is also an issue. One example is Caning, used in Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore is considered to be cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.Amnesty International Report 2008: Singapore In Mexico, Life Imprisonment without parole is also considered to be cruel and unusual punishment. Other issues, such as Police Brutality and impunity for Human Rights violatorsAmnesty International - No Hiding Place for Torture - 5 June 2008 are also serious issues.\u000aFetal rights{{Main}}Fetal rights are the legal or ethical rights of human fetuses. The term is used most often in the context of the abortion debate, as the basis for an argument in support of the pro-life stance.\u000aReproductive rights{{Main}}\u000aReproductive rights are rights relating to reproduction and reproductive health.{{cite journal}} The World Health Organisation defines reproductive rights as follows:{{cquote}}Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nation''s 1968 International Conference on Human Rights. The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children."{{cite journal}}{{cite web}}Reproductive rights may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to control one''s reproductive functions, the right to quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence.{{cite web}} Reproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections, and freedom from coerced sterilization and contraception, protection from gender-based practices such as female genital cutting (FGC) and male genital mutilation (MGM).National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers\u000aMedicineIn Canada several legal medical marijuana patients have filed human rights complaints over their discrimination and treatment.Russell Barth''s Ontario Human Rights Challenge Against the Ontario GovernmentSettlement in Gator Ted''s pot case: Medical marijuana smoker claimed discrimination\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a\u000aAmnesty International\u000aCustomary international law\u000aDiscrimination\u000aEconomic freedom\u000aFreedom (political)\u000aGlobal governance\u000aGlobal Human Rights Defence\u000aList of human rights organisations\u000aCambodian Center for Human Rights\u000aSithi - Cambodia Human Rights Portal (Sithi)\u000aHuman responsibilities\u000aHuman Rights Watch\u000aHuman security\u000aPolitical repression\u000aRule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project (RULAC)\u000aWarsaw Confederation\u000a\u000a\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aFurther reading2010\u000a\u000aElliesie, Hatem (2010):  Beitr\u00e4ge zum Islamischen Recht VII: Islam und Menschenrechte / Islam and Human Rights / al-islam wa-huquq al-insan, Frankfurt a.M., Berlin, Bern, Bruxelles, New York, Oxford, Wien, ISBN 978-3-631-57848-3\u000a2009\u000a\u000aForsythe, Frederick P., Encyclopedia of Human Rights (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009)\u000aJones, Lindsay.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(60,0,'In its most general form, humanitarianism is an ethic of kindness, benevolence and sympathy extended universally and impartially to all human beings. Humanitarianism has been an evolving concept historically but universality is a common element in its evolution. No distinction is to be made in the face of human suffering or abuse on grounds of gender, tribal, caste, religious or national divisions. \u000aHumanitarian beliefsThe universality of Humanitarianism is exemplified in one of the first statements of the ethic, the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan. The answer to the lawyer''s question\u2014''And who is my neighbour?'', is that ''your neighbour'' is anyone in need whom you can help. Humanitarianism is an ethic of active compassion which became expressed in philanthropy and social welfare. From an exclusive concern with charity, humanitarian action was led increasingly to vindication of the respect owed to the individual human being. This idea, originating in stoic natural law, became, in its Christian and secular manifestations, an important influence in European thought. Not immediately, but eventually, denial of the spiritual equality inhering in every human being became the touchstone of ''wrongness'' in humanitarian action.The Enlightenment advanced the idea that humanity could be improved by reform of laws and change in social structure. This idea combined with the humanitarian ethic of active compassion. Both became the impelling influences upon humanitarian social action from the 18th century.Humanism is associated with the Renaissance and the revival of classical learning which took place in the 15th century. This cultural and educational strand is not part of Humanitarianism but both Humanitarianism and Humanism share a common view as to the importance of ''Man''. Unlike Humanitarianism, humanism tends to exclude any religious basis for that importance. A major difference is that Humanism was not impelled to engage in action to protest abuses or move collectively for the relief of human suffering. Nevertheless, in so far as the Renaissance was a precursor to the Enlightenment, humanism and humanitarianism shared the value of autonomy, articulated in the Enlightenment, and both equally rejected superstition as a justification for socially approved cruelty. Humanitarianism and Human Rights are closely associated. Both movements are grounded upon the moral significance of the individual human being. However, compassion and the alleviation of suffering are not necessary in order to give effect to a human right; and thus that original and basic element in humanitarianism forms no part of ''Human Rights''. The question though, in relation to humanitarian reform, is whether the denial of a human right and the abuses which humanitarians seek to reform, are generically the same or differ and, if so, in what way. Humanitarianism did not campaign against abuses on the ground of human rights but in the name of humanity. The wrongs which the Humanitarian movement addressed related to violation of moral duties imposed upon State or Society in relation to the treatment of human beings. These duties are substantially unqualified and do not depend upon the consent or absence of consent of persons affected. Thus, under international law slavery and the slave trade are absolutely prohibited. There is no emergency or other exception. Torture is similarly absolute. A ''right'', in the strict sense, requires a ''right-holder''. It is the negation of a right if the person advantaged has no option whether to make or decline to make a moral claim. The duty consequent upon a right may not arise until the right has been exercised. The moral claims of slaves and of forced laborers exist independently of their objection. Slavery, torture, cruel punishments cannot be absolved by consent. In the 18th and 19th centuries the ethic of active compassion coalesced with other ideas and the interaction resulting from this turned humanitarianism in the direction of reform These accompanying ideas were: rationalism, individualism and of the concept of social and legal reform. \u000aThe idea of social reformThe Enlightenment idea of reform combined with the ethic of active compassion to inspire the social action of the humanitarian movement. Professor G. M. Trevelyan in his Social History of England has explained the humanitarian movement as a product of the influence of rationalism upon puritanism.\u201cThe rationalist movement had shaken the persecutor\u2019s sword from the hand of faith and religion had been to school with her rival reason. From Milton to Wilberforce the road lay through Voltaire.\u201dTrevelyan, G.M: "A Shortened History of England", page 384. Pelican, 1970Trevelyan, G.M: "Illustrated English Social History", Volume 3, page 103. Pelican, 1964.The reformers diverged widely in their underlying beliefs but were united in their humanitarianism. Thus the Christian individualism of the Quakers, that each person shares the \u2018inner light\u2019Trevelyan, G.M: "Illustrated History of England", page 431. Longmans, Green and Co.,1956 and the ArminianismMacMaculloch,D: "Reformation", pages 373\u2013378.Penguin Books,2003. of the Evangelicals were both differently based from the Lockean or Kantian individualism of a Philosophe or a Utilitarian, but all recognized the equal moral significance of the human person and that the disregard of it was wrong. What also united them was the new idea of reform to remove those wrongs. And so in many of the major areas of humanitarian reform, Christians and rationalists worked together: in the case of slavery; Wilberforce, the Buxtons but also Bentham and Condorcet; in the case of working conditions; evangelicals such as Lord Shaftesbury but also Robert Owen and Edwin Chadwick; in the case of punishments Beccaria but also Samuel Romilly; in the case of the mentally ill; Shaftesbury and Pinel and in the case of the treatment of animals, Bentham enlisted the aid of Wilberforce.\u000a\u000aThe idea that mankind could be improved by deliberate social change as distinct from the conferring of charity and the doing of \u2018good works\u2019 was relatively new. For all intents and purposes social and legal reform was a product of the Enlightenment. Its origins lay in the belief in the dominance of reason and that \u2018Man\u2019 was perfectible, if only the social conditions in which he or she lived would allow it. Most Enlightenment thinkers believed \u2018man\u2019 to be fundamentally good: \u201che was once free but is now everywhere in chains\u201d. Voltaire in his Portable Dictionary said that \u201cit is want that subjects one man to another.\u201d Mankind would be perfected by knowledge \u2013 hence the great Encyclopaedia of Diderot and D\u2019Alembert. Helvetius (1715\u20131771) made this philosophy very popular. He believed human character to be a product of social environment. The chief instruments enabling this to be done would be education and legislation. There thus grew up the demand for legal reform. If \u2018laws are good, morals are good\u2019 said Diderot.Reform distinguished the humanitarian movement from charity and philanthropy. Speaking of the charitable and philanthropic institutions of the 19th century industrial era, Ernst Troeltsch said, \u201ctheir aim was a new spirit, not a new society.\u201dTroeltsch, E: "The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches", page 135. Allen and Unwin, 1931. Christian philanthropy tended to deprecate reform as political. For the humanitarian movement, however, removal of the abuse causing suffering was the essence. The goal in almost every field of action undertaken by the humanitarian movement required changed social conditions and in many instances this could only be brought about through legislation.\u000aIndividualismThe question arises as to the basis for the humanitarian movement''s claim of \u2018wrongness\u2019 in the social conditions which it sought to eradicate or reform? The criterion of wrongness was not cruelty. It is true cruelty was often a manifestation of the social abuse or \u2018wrongness\u2019. Public reaction to cruelty was often vital to the mobilization of social action. But it was not the criterion. If, in the case of slavery, it had been otherwise, the movement would have been satisfied with improved treatment of the slaves. Historically, both in ancient Rome and in the southern states of America, many masters and their families were kind to their slaves and in late Rome and southern America, laws were in force prohibiting maltreatment of slaves. But this was never the aim of the humanitarian movement. It sought the abolition of slavery and not its amelioration. The institution was wrong. It was wrong even if no slave were suffering cruelty in the ordinary sense of the term. It was wrong because by virtue of the institution of slavery the master was able to subjugate the freedom and autonomy of another human being.David Brion Davis, leading historian on slavery, sought its origins as an extension of the domestication of animals, an attempt to turn human beings into beasts of burden, Davis, D. B: \u201cInhuman Bondage; The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World\u201d Oxford University Press, 2006. Reviewed in Frederickson, G: \u2018They\u2019ll take their stand\u2019, page 34. \u201cNew York Review of Books\u201d, May 25, 2006.The principle of European individualism upon which the humanitarian movement was based was that every human being was of equal moral significance and it was the disregard of that moral significance which constituted the abuses against which the movement was directed. European individualism can be traced to the Greeks. It was the stoics, who like Aristotle, attributed significance to the human soul; but who, unlike Aristotle, considered every human beingAristotle: "Politics", pages 213 & 327. Everyman Library. equal in that significance. Natural law, as the stoics conceived it, was based upon this principle of spiritual equality. Positive law was subject to the law of nature and, hence, uniquely to the ancient world, the stoics opposed slavery.D\u2019Entreves: "Natural Law". Harper Torchbooks, 1965.Medieval Christianity both conserved and transformed the ideal, largely limiting equality to the capacity of each believer to attain posthumous salvation. In 18th century Enlightenment Europe, the individualistic idea of the equal moral significance of the individual in \u2018this-world\u2019, re-emerged grounded upon reason and personal autonomy, not upon the equal capacity to escape damnation in the next world.Russell, B: "A History of Western Philosophy", page 293. 1946.It was the disregard of moral significance in this sense which constituted the \u2018wrongs\u2019 identified by the humanitarian movement and justified social action in the case of slavery, the maltreatment of the working class in the 19th century; the brutality of criminal punishments and the use of torture in the criminal justice system; the treatment of the insane; the subjection of women to an inferior status and the inhumanities of colonialism.Prevention of cruelty to animals involved an extension of the principle to non-human animals. The stoics had grounded moral significance on capacity to reason. St. Paul and St Augustine reflected this view and it became part of the Catholic tradition. Pope Leo XIII enunciated this in Rerum Novarum.\u201dBut animal nature, however perfect, is far from representing the human being in its completeness, and it is in truth humanity\u2019s humble hand maid, to serve and obey\u201d.Encyclical Rerum Novarum of Leo XIII, 15 May 1891. Retrieved April 22, 2009 The humanitarian movement attributed moral significance to non-human animals and sought the introduction of laws to protect them.\u000aConclusionThe Christian ethic of active compassion combined with rationalism, individualism and reformism. Although \u2018wrongness\u2019 was the ultimate criterion of social action for the humanitarian movement and \u2018reform\u2019 the method by which it was achieved, this would not have taken place without the energy generated by the ethic of active compassion. Reform was usually led by a small number of humanitarians but with the advent of democracy would not have gone further without community acceptance. The observance of suffering by the community does not necessarily give rise to compassion. It may do so - but society seems able to accept the infliction of pain on other human beings where it has the support and apparent justification of current social values. Thus for centuries the suffering of witches and heretics being burnt at the stake failed to arouse a compassionate response: nor did brutal punishments such as boiling to death and whipping. Great crowds gathered to witness public executions. Until the nineteenth century visitors would go to Bedlam as if to a zoo. Bear baiting and cock-fighting were enjoyable pastimes. A change in values from what had been the socially acceptable infliction of suffering may allow compassion to be released. The medical explanation of insanity advanced by Phillipe Pinel and others enabled the insane to be looked at through a quite different lens and reveal them to be sick human beings. Thereafter, lunatics were no longer chained, flogged or half-drowned in wells. And once crime had ceased to be viewed theologically as sin, the necessary infliction of pain involved in criminal punishments no longer provided an excuse for sadism.  Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s moving description of the treatment of slaves in \u2018Uncle Tom''s Cabin\u2019, published in 1852, led her wide international readership to recognize\u2014in some instances for the first time, the cruelty and oppression of slavery. In this and similar instances the resulting public reaction of outrage to cruelty and compassion for those who suffered was the final but necessary catalyst to reform.\u000aThe reforms of the humanitarian movementIn the 18th century conflicting religious belief became tolerated to a degree unthinkable one hundred years before. Witchcraft disappeared. Torture was abolished. During the nineteenth century slavery was abolished; women began the agitation that would ultimately lead to universal suffrage; criminal punishments became more enlightened; laws were passed to prevent cruelty to children; treatment of the insane was humanised and working conditions were made almost tolerable. Pressure on Parliament by humanitarians led to regulation of working hours and amelioration of working conditions. The Factory Act of 1833 and the Factory Act of 1844 was some of the most significant humanitarian legislation passed. In the middle of the 19th century, humanitarianism was central to the work of Florence Nightingale in the alleviation of suffering in the Crimea. An international dimension was added to humanitarian reform with the founding of the International Red Cross. Finally, cruelty to animals became punishable. Religious toleration came from above. It did not follow popular agitation. Indeed, popular feeling tended if anything in the reverse direction as it did, more clearly, in the case of the abolition of witchcraft. By contrast, the social action in the nineteenth century was in all cases greatly influenced by popular feeling and, in some instances, popular agitation. The initiating force remained with small groups of reformers.  These groups set about energising public opinion. This often became the immediate cause of legislative action. One reason for the change was the advent of democracy - limited though it was until well into the nineteenth century. Also, communications had become easier. The industrial proletariat crowding into the new cities made it feasible to hold the mass meetings such as those we associate with Wesley. The population was increasingly literate. Political pamphlets had first circulated in England during the civil war. By the end of the eighteenth century the number of newspapers had made it financially worthwhile to impose a tax upon them. In one form or another the written word was part of social action. In fiction, novels like Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin and those of Charles Dickens drew attention to social wrongs and inspired reformist action. This change of audience led to a change in the mode of approach which became less philosophical and more obviously emotive, fastening on the cruelty which frequently accompanied the inhumanity to which social action was directed.\u000aAbolition of slavery In 1503, following the voyage of Columbus, the Spanish Governor in the Indies, Orvando, commenced using Indians in the mines. Las Casas, the Bishop who accompanied him, observed the fearful toll the work took on the Indians. Las Casas suggested they be replaced by Negroes. Thus the fateful beginning of the transatlantic slave trade from Africa. Some 900,000 slaves were landed in the Americas by 1600.Thomas,H: "The Slave Trade", page 21, Papermac,1997. From the 17th century demand for African labour expanded greatly with the increased importation of sugar into Europe. It was in that century that slavery became recognized as a lawful status in Massachusetts in 1641; in Connecticut in 1650 and in Virginia in 1661. The 18th century saw England\u2019s rise to dominance in the trade. By 1770 British traders were exporting 40,000 to 60,000 slaves annually. At that time the trade was chiefly carried on from Liverpool and by the end of the 18th century more than half the trade was British.Once a ship was loaded with its slave cargo it embarked upon the \u2018middle passage\u2019 to Brazil or the Caribbean. Ships averaged 150 tonnes. Each ship carried 600 slaves who were chained to shelves below deck during the voyage. \u201cPacked in the holds of the galleys \u2026the slaves were given no more than four to five feet in length and two or three feet in height so that neither could lie down full length nor sit upright.They were chained, right hand to left leg, and attached in rows to long iron bars.\u201dC.L.R. James quoted in Harris, R: "Jazz", page 19. Penguin, 1954. The death rate varied from 19-20%. On arrival the slaves were auctioned. Then followed the \u2018seasoning\u2019 which usually lasted 12 months or so. About a third died in the seasoning.Encyc. Britt. , 1994 \u2013 98, Africans - Process of EnslavementThere was a very high death toll. In Jamaica, there were 40,000 slaves in 1690. From then until 1810, 800,000 slaves were imported and yet only 340,000 remained on the island 1958. It is estimated that between 1680 and 1786 the total number of slaves exported into all the British colonies in America was 2,130,000.This figure was apparently first calculated by the pro-slavery apologist Bryan Edwards (1791), see Encyc. Britt. 1958 Vol 20, p.780see D\u2019Souza, "The End of Racism", p.115,The Free Press, 1995.  When the nature of the trade became known it was denounced by a wide range of people. John Wesley published his Thoughts on SlaveryWesley, J: "Thoughts on Slavery". Retrieved April 23, 2009 in 1774.The Quakers were among the first to take action largely through the influence of John Woolman and Anthony Benezet. In 1754 John Woolman prepared a Letter which was distributed by the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting expressing concern at Quaker involvement in slavery. In 1758, influenced by Woolman, the Philadelphia Yearly meeting altered its traditional policy so that henceforth all members who bought or sold Negroes were to be excluded from business meetings or from making contributions to the Society. In 1760 the New England Quakers made importation of slaves an offence subject to discipline.\u000aGreat BritainThe process of abolition in Great Britain and the Empire went through a number of stages: the elimination of slavery internally; that is its prohibition and non-recognition within \u000aGreat Britain; the abolition of the slave trade from British ports and by British traders; the prohibition of slavery within the British dominions.In England slavery was declared unlawful in 1772 by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield, on a writ of habeas corpus which came before him brought by a slave, Somersett. Somersett was being held in irons in the holds of a ship lying in the Thames and the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp"Sources of English Constitutional History", Harper Historical Series\u2019, page 10. Harper & Brothers.A somewhat different account is given by H.de B Gibbins, "English Social Reformers", page 100. Methuen &Co, 1892. instituted proceedings on his behalf. The effect of the decision was that no person could thereafter be a slave on English soil and any slave brought to England would immediately be set free.The slave trade continued unabated. In 1783 public opposition to it was aroused by the case of the slave ship Zong. The ship with 442 slaves had lost its way. With water short the master Colingwood explained to his crew that if the slaves died naturally from thirst the loss would lie on the shipowner but if, on some pretext, such as \u2018safety of the crew\u2019 they had to be thrown into the sea to drown, the loss would fall on the underwriters: and so 133 slaves were thrown into the sea.Thomas, H: page 488. Op. Cit.In 1787 William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson and a group of friends, mostly of Anglican evangelicals, formed an association to carry forward a campaign for abolition in Parliament and throughout the country. On 12 May 1787 Wilberforce brought forward the first of many motions in the House of Commons. It was defeated but he had a powerful ally in his friend, the Prime Minister, William Pitt. In 1791 his second motion sought to ban the further importation of slaves into the British colonies in the West Indies. It was defeated by 163 votes to 88. In 1792, after a magnificent speech by Pitt, the House of Commons accepted a resolution that the trade should be abolished in stages but this was defeated in the House of Lords. In 1795 Wilberforce would have secured the passage of a private Bill prohibiting the supply of foreign slaves by English merchants, had not twelve of his supporters gone to the opera. In 1804 Wilberforce\u2019s Abolition Bill passed in the Commons again but was thrown out in the Lords. Finally, in 1807, a Bill passed both Houses putting an end to British traders engaging in the foreign supply of slaves and prohibiting the importation of slaves into colonies won by Britain during the Napoleonic wars. The departure of any vessel to obtain slaves from any port within the British dominions after 1 May 1807 was prohibited and no slave could be landed in British colonies after 1 May 1808.The Act of 1807 was disregarded as the purely pecuniary penalties were insufficient. It was not until Brougham carried a Bill through the Parliament subjecting offenders to transportation that the slave trade to the British Dominions was finally extinguished.Although, therefore by about 1820 the trading in slaves had been widely prohibited, slavery itself had not been prohibited in the British colonies or in the British dominions. Wilberforce took up this cause but he was ageing and so in 1821 he appealed to Thomas Buxton to press in Parliament for abolition of slavery within the colonies and dominions. An anti-slavery body was formed including, in addition to Wilberforce and Buxton, Macaulay and Brougham. Because of hostility to the measure in the colonies its passage through parliament proved difficult. Finally, Earl Grey took the decisive step and introduced the Bill. Wilberforce, although dying before its enactment, knew on his deathbed that his long battle had been won. \u201cThank God I should have lived to witness this day\u201d,he said. Twenty million pounds was paid as compensation to the planters.Gibbins conveniently sums up the history of abolition of slavery and the slave trade in England and its colonies. Gibbins: "English Social Reformers", page 104. Methuen, 1892.\u000aOther countries\u000aThe effective prohibition on British ships gave foreign slave traders an advantage which they speedily took up despite intervention to stop them carried out by British cruisers. \u000aIt became imperative to include other countries in the ban:\u000a\u000aDenmark: On 16 March 1792 King Christian VII issued a decree forbidding any Danish subject from taking part in the trade after 1 January 1803 \u2013 Denmark thus became the first country to ban the trade;\u000aSweden (1813): Sweden had banned the trade, having been given substantial compensation for Guadeloupe;\u000aThe Netherlands(1814): The Dutch were persuaded to stop the trade by the cession of the East Indies;\u000aPortugal (1815): Portugal agreed to prohibit the trade north of the equator and to prohibit it elsewhere by 1823 for which it received 300 pounds from the British government;\u000aBrazil (1888): Prohibition of the slave trade between Brazil and Portugal was only imperfectly enforced. The Emperor of Brazil Dom Pedro II was personally very much opposed to slavery but on abolishing it, the planters rose up and exiled him to Europe;\u000aSpain (1817): A Treaty was signed with Spain under which she agreed to abolish the slave trade north of the Equator and suppress it totally by 30 May 1820 for which the British government paid Spain 400,000 pounds;\u000aFrance (1814): The thinkers of the Enlightenment had opposed slavery since Voltaire had mocked the slave traders in Candide.Voltaire: "Candide". Retrieved on April 23, 2009 In 1788 the \u2018Societe des Amis des Noirs\u2019 was formed in Paris to bring about the abolition of the slave trade and of slavery itself. Marquis de Condorcet was its first President. In August 1789 the Declaration of the Rights of Man"Declaration of the Rights of Man, 1789", Retrieved on 23 April, 2009 embodied the right of \u2018natural liberty\u2019 and thus rejected slavery. Alarmed at the discontent among the planters of San Domingo, the National Assembly passed a resolution that the Declaration was not intended to apply to colonies or at least to their internal affairs. The Assembly adverted to the fact the Declaration also protected the right of property. This resulted in rebellion in San Domingo. By 1798 the French were ejected and slavery abolished. In May 1814 France and England were in near agreement that France would cease participation in the trade when Napoleon I of France escaped from Elba. One of Napoleon\u2019s first acts upon reaching Paris was to abolish all the slave trade which was engaged in with the French dominions.\u000a\u000aThe example of Great Britain was then followed by the following countries in abolishing slavery within their dominions : in 1848 the slaves in all France\u2019s colonies were immediately emancipatedThe French situation is somewhat confusing.In 1794 the Convention voted to abolish slavery but in 1802 Napoleon exempted the colonies from metropolitan legislation. In 1814 the slave-trade with the French dominions was abolished. In 1848 slavery in the French dominions was abolished.; in 1853 the Dutch commenced emancipation of slaves within their possessions; in 1858 it was enacted that every slave belonging to a Portuguese subject should be freed within 20 years and, from 29 April 1878, slavery became illegal throughout Portuguese possessions; the government of Buenos Aires enacted that all children of slaves after the 31 January 1813 should be free; in Columbia those born after 16 July 1821 were to be liberated upon attaining 18 and Mexico ended slavery on 15 September 1829.\u000aThe United StatesThe population of the slave states in America on the eve of the civil war in 1860 was 8,098,000 of whom 4,204,000 were black. There were 385,000 slave-holders:of these the 46,000 who owned more than 20 slaves were \u2018planters\u2019. By the 1830s the North, which had itself renounced slavery, was increasingly influenced by the abolitionist movement in England. The opposition to slavery widened. Perhaps, as Abraham Lincoln said in his Presidential campaign,the Union had to become one or the other. It could not remain slave and non-slave. In 1852 Harriet Beecher Stowe published Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. It had a powerful effect on both sides of the Atlantic. It described the cruelties of the system and the horrors of remote plantations. By the end of 1852 hundreds of thousands of copies of the book had been sold in the United States.Event followed event. The Kansas-Nebraska Act saw an attempt in Congress to move the \u2018slavery -- anti-slavery line\u2019 north of that which had been agreed. Then followed the Dred Scott decision in the Supreme Court in March 1857. The Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the constitutional power to interfere with the property of United States citizens. Slaves were property. The decision provoked a storm in the north.Lincoln was elected President on 6 November 1860. On the 20th December, the state of South Carolina declared its secession from the Union. Next day Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas followed suit. In February 1861 these states, other than Texas, formed the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis was chosen President. On 14 April President Davis demanded the surrender of the Union force at Fort Sumter. When the demand was rejected the Fort was bombarded. The civil war had begun.President Lincoln\u2019s proclamation emancipating the slaves took effect on the 1st January 1863.Brogan, H: "The Penguin History of the United States of America" pages 341&342. Penguin Books, 1990. With the defeat of the South, slavery was in effect finished in the United States. In order to implement abolition entirely a constitutional amendment was required. The thirteenth Amendment came into force after Lincoln\u2019s assassination, prohibiting slavery throughout the Union.\u000aThe conditions of workers in the 19th century1760 may be taken as the approximate date for the beginning of the industrial revolution. England was the leading country.  In the following decade James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny and James Watt, the steam engine. Richard Arkwright\u2019s water frame spinning machine enabled the weaving of whole cotton goods for the first time. Mechanization thus began in the cotton trade. Mills became located beside the water from the Pennine streams and extended to the plains below. Next came the application of coal in iron smelting.The break with the past was complete. The enclosures had forced cottagers and farmers off their land. Handicraft industry had gone. In its place were the \u2018dark, satanic mills\u2019 of William Blake\u2019s imagery. People lived and died in sight of the cotton mill in which they spent from 14\u201316 hours of their daily lives. It was inevitable that eventually the new factories would concentrate an increasing population in the cities. Thus in the case of Manchester the population increased tenfold between 1760 and 1830, from 17,000 to 180,000.Braudel, F: "The Perspective of the World: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 19th centuries", page 564. Collins, 1981 - 84. In the factories children went to work soon after their sixth birthday. Orphans and pauper children would be collected from the Parish Work Houses in London and Birmingham and sent to the industrial centres of Nottinghamshire and Lancashire where they worked extremely long hours. \u201cOne relay of children rose wearily from their beds as another relay came to throw themselves down in their places. They were fed on the coarsest and cheapest food..\u201dH de B Gibbons, "English Social Reformers", pp.114\u2013115. Methuen, 1982 In the chimneys, masters found it cheaper to drive the chimney boys up the chimney than use long brushes. Not only were women were worked in the mines but they were forced to do heavy work for extremely long hours. In the factories, as late as December 1841, Leonard Horner, an Inspector of Factories reported that industrial workers working a 14 hour day.Eventually, justice and equality between capital and labour was achieved by Trade Unions, parliamentary reform and, in some countries, revolution or the fear of it. But for a time the humanitarian movement was the only barrier to the inhumanity suffered by the labouring classes. Broadly this was the state of England from 1802 when the Combination Act was passed until the Ten Hour Bill was enacted in 1848. During this period it was the humanitarian movement which fought for laws to establish humane working conditions in factories and in the mines, reasonable hours of work and restrictions on the employment of women and children.The movement was led by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury (1801\u20131885) who was strongly supported by Tory radicals. Others were Michael Sadler (1780\u20131835), a Wesleyan Methodist, who had a business importing Irish linen; Richard Oastler (1789\u20131861), a land agent from a Wesleyan background; Edwin Chadwick (1800\u20131890) who had been Bentham\u2019s secretary and Robert Owen (1771\u20131758). Owen was not an evangelical nor a utilitarian. Indeed he emphatically rejected Christianity. He was a Manchester cotton spinner who had made a fortune whilst young. Distressed by the conditions of workers at the Mills he set about giving them fairer conditions first at Manchester and afterwards at New Lanark, in Scotland, where he operated a large cotton mill from 1820 to 1829. Owen had thoroughly absorbed the Enlightenment idea of the perfectibility of man through improved social conditions.He wrote about it and practised it in his own business life.In 1815 Owen, apparently single-handedly, started an agitation for factory reform. He drafted a Bill to apply to all textile factories. It would have prohibited the employment of all children under 10 and prohibited night work for children under 18. He also wanted the working day for children restricted to 10\u00bd hours per day. The Bill was fiercely opposed and rejected. Speaking in the House of Lords, James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale said, \u201csuch things as this ought to be left entirely to the moral feelings of perhaps the most moral people on the face of the earth.\u201d Ultimately the Factory Act 1819, which was not Owen\u2019s Bill, was passed. It provided that \u201cno child shall be employed for the spinning of cotton into yarn \u2026 until he shall have attained the full age of 9 years\u201d and \u201cno person under 18 shall be employed in the spinning of cotton wool into yarn for more than 12 hours, exclusive of the necessary time taken for meals\u201d. Owen was disillusioned but even this inadequate measure would not have become law but for him.The next major effort took place when about a decade later Michael Sadler prepared new legislation to restrict hours of workIn his impassioned speech to the House of Commons on the introduction of this legislation, Sadler said: \u201cthen in order to keep them awake, to stimulate their exertions, means are made use of to which I shall now advert as a last instance of the degradation to which this system has reduced the manufacturing operatives of this country. Children are beaten with thongs, prepared for the purpose. Yes, the females of this country, no matter whether children or grown up\u2026. are beaten, beaten in your free market of labour as you term it, like slaves. The poor wretch is flogged before its companions \u2013 flogged, I say, like a dog, before the tyrant overlooker\u201d, quoted by H de B. Gibbons, op.cit.p.124 but before it could go before Parliament he was disenfranchised as a result of changes brought about by the 1832 Reform Act. It was then that Lord Shaftsbury was approached to lead the movement. He accepted. He put forward a Ten Hour Bill, the first in the long struggle to achieve that basic benchmark. The opposition proved overwhelming. But Lord Althorp an opponent of the measure introduced an amending Bill designed in some way to accommodate Shaftesbury\u2019s position. The Factory Act 1833 provided that no person under 18 should be employed for more than 12 hours in any day or for more than 69 hours in a week. Manufacturers bitterly opposed this modified measure and, to circumvent it, introduced the relay system so that one set of children worked from 5.30 to 1.30 and the next from 1.30 to 8.30.In 1842 a Royal Commission reported on conditions in the mines which profoundly affected public opinion. The Coal Mines Regulation Act 1842 which Shaftsbury pursued in Parliament prohibited the employment of girls and women in mines altogether.The crisis in Factory legislation came to a head with a renewed attempt at a Ten Hour Bill, the basic aspiration of the workers. Factory and Mill owners opposed the measure. The whole issue became entangled with the repeal of the Corn Laws. The Bill was fought at every stage. A magnificent speech by Macaulay heaping scorn on the \u2018freedom of contract\u2019 arguments of Bright, Cobden and Pease was of immense importance in the debate but all the humanitarians \u2013 Shaftesbury, Oastler, Fielden and others were instrumental in securing passage of the Bill. It became law on the 1st May 1848. Employers set about circumventing it and for a time were successful. It was not until July 1850 that the Ten Hour working day became a reality.\u201cThe Act (10 Vict.c 29)  provided: (i) a Ten Hours Day for women and young persons (ii) fixed a legal day as any ten hours between 5.30 am to 8.30 pm.Later on (1850), owing to abuse of the relay system by manufacturers, a uniform working day was fixed \u2013 from 6am to 6pm, with an hour and a half for meals, and work for protected persons to cease after 2pm on Saturday.\u201d, H de B Gibbons,op.cit. p.136The importance of the humanitarian movement in the fight for humane working conditions in industrial England did not cease with the Ten Hour Bill. Shaftesbury secured protection for chimney sweepers in the Chimney Sweepers Act 1877. But humanitarianism became more directed to philanthropy than legislative reform.In England the claims of the worker were pursued by the Trade Unions and the Labour Party in Parliament. On the Continent industrialisation began later. By 1848 the Communist Manifesto had been published with a fully developed theory of revolutionary socialism. The rise of the working class on the continent began not with humanitarianism but with the Revolution or uprisings of 1848. In France the regulation of hours of work began in that year, in Belgium and Holland about the same time, in Germany somewhat later and still later in Italy and Austria.\u000aThe humanising of criminal punishments\u000aMedieval punishments were cruel and, in many respects, that remained the position in the 18th century: hanging, drawing and quartering, beheading, boiling and lesser punishments designed only to humiliate such as the pillory and placing an offender in the stocks.\u201cThe Carolina, a criminal code of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, issued in 1530, is a hideous catalogue of blinding mutilation, tearing with hot pincers, burning alive and breaking on the wheel. In England poisoners were boiled to death, even as lately as 1542, as in the cases of Rouse and Margaret Downie, the barbarous penalty for high treason \u2013 hanging, drawing and quartering\u2014is well known, while that for petty treason was enforced no longer ago than 1726 on Catherine Hayes who was burned at Tyburn for murdering her husband. By the laws of Christian IV of Denmark in 1683 blasphemers were beheaded after having the tongue cut out. As recently as 1706 at Hanover, a pastor named Zachoree George Flugge was burned for coining.\u201d, Lea, Henry C: "History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages", Harbor Press, 1955.Reform was, in the first instance, a product of the Enlightenment. The reformer who led in this was the Italian, Cesare Beccaria. Arthur Koestler has written of Beccaria that \u201cthere was perhaps no single humanist since Erasmus of Rotterdam who, without being attached to a definite political or religious movement, had such a deep effect on European thought.\u201d He published his great work Dei Delitte e delle pene in 1764. Within a year his fame was worldwide.Dei Delitte e delle pene was the first serious work devoted exclusively to the question of criminal justice. Beccaria emphasised the importance of certainty and of promptness in punishment if it were to be effective as a deterrent and proportionality if it was to be just. \u2013 that is, a due proportion between the seriousness of the crime and the punishment imposed. He opposed the doctrine of maximum severity. That doctrine had been greatly favoured especially in England upon the view that the sole object of criminal punishment was prevention. Whether the penalty was proportionate to the offence was of no great consequence. In Beccaria\u2019s view maximum severity only hardened criminals and bred impunity."With a boldness and ruthlessness Beccarria surveyed one after another various aspects of the established systems of justice. His judgement was stern and unsparing but having destroyed, he at once proceeded to rebuild. His constructive proposals, which taken together, formed a complete system of criminal law and procedure such as had never before been evolved with equal precision and thoroughness\u201d, Radzinowicz, L: "A History of English Criminal Law", Vol1, page 279, Stevens, 1948 - 86.Beccaria corresponded with monarchs. Voltaire wrote a commentary to the first French edition of his work and was influential in disseminating his ideas. During his lifetime his proposals were embodied in the laws of Russia, Sweden, Austria, Tuscany and Greece. Becarria greatly influenced Frederick the Great and as a result of Frederick\u2019s personal zeal the Prussian Criminal Code was revised and rationalised. The death penalty in Prussia was greatly reduced. On the 22 August 1772 Gustavus III of Sweden abolished torture and thereafter comprehensively revised the criminal code, the revision coming into effect on 20 January 1779. Maria Theresa of Austria did not accept Becarria\u2019s ideas but her sons Joseph and Leopold, did. Joseph II who succeeded his mother thoroughly revised the Austrian Code. The revised code came into force on the 13th January 1787 and was the first to abolish capital punishment for every offence other than treason or murder. Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany passed an edict putting Becarria\u2019s ideas into effect. In 1791 the French reflected his influence in a new penal code. To these general developments there was one exception. England. As Koestler has written, \u201cthrough more than a century England ran against the current\u201d.Koestler, A: "Reflections on Hanging", page 43. Victor Gollancz, 1956. In 1688 there were about 50 capital offences in England. Between 1660 and 1819 these increased greatly and 187 capital offences were enacted. Death was the only punishment for these offences although many differed greatly in seriousness. To avoid uncertainty the Courts were allowed no discretion for extenuating circumstances. This extremity even extended to children. As late as 1831 a boy aged 9 was publicly hanged at Chelmsford for having set fire to a house. During the 18th century, transportation was the only alternative to death for most offences.There are three explanations for this severity. England was the first country to experience industrialisation, rapid population growth and urban congestion. During the 19th century London\u2019s population had increased by 1 million to 6.7 million. Crime festered. It was estimated that towards the end of the previous century there were 8000 receivers of stolen property in the city. Second, England had no organized police force and resolutely refused to have one, until finally in 1829 Peel succeeded in its establishment. Thirdly, the English criminal justice procedures, including the jury system, in the 18th century, were favourable to the accused.Against the background of an absence of organized law enforcement and liberal criminal procedures, penalties were savagely increased. This and the inflexible imposition of the death penalty had its philosophic support in the doctrine of maximum severity espoused by a number of English writers of whom the best known was William Paley. In 1785, the Reverend Martin Madan published Thoughts on Executive JusticeMadam, M: "Thoughts on Executive Justice", Retrieved on 26 April, 2009 urging the doctrine of maximum severity. Samuel Romilly (1757\u20131818) who had been greatly influenced by Becarria published a reply in which he strongly criticised the doctrine. But at the end of the century the \u2018bloody code\u2019 was still intact. The struggle for its repeal took place between 1808 and 1837. In 1808, when Romilly was contemplating his great campaign the number of capital statutes stood at 220. He proceeded cautiously. In February 1810Radzinowicz: "A History of English Criminal Law",Vol.1,pages 497\u2013498. Stevens, 1948. he introduced separate Bills to repeal three Acts, all of which imposed the death penalty: the first was for stealing privately in a shop for 5 shillings; the second for stealing in a dwelling house to the value of 40 shillings and the third for the same amount on navigable rivers.Speaking on this measure in the House of Lords, Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough said \u201cI trust your Lordships will pause before you assent to an experiment pregnant with danger to the security of property \u2026\u201d Despite a brilliant speech by Romilly, all Bills were defeated. But his Bill to repeal capital punishment for theft in a dwelling was defeated by only two votes.In 1811 Romilly re-introduced the three Bills which had failed and introduced two others, one of which sought the repeal of the death penalty for stealing 10 shillings from bleaching grounds. This Bill proved to be important because it was supported by 150 bleaching ground proprietors who claimed that juries were refusing to convict where the death penalty would be imposed.Romilly\u2019s Bill for repeal of the death penalty for stealing in a shop to the value of five shillings was passed by the Commons, but defeated in the Lords on six occasions: 1811,1813,1816, 1818 and 1820. Romilly did not live to see the Bill passed. In the course of his life he succeeded in getting only three capital statutes repealed. He suicided, a defeated man a few days after his wife\u2019s death in 1818. But soon after, resistance began to crumble. Petitions from enterprises concerned with the number of acquittals, such as those from the bleaching ground proprietors, forced a Committee to be set up in 1819. Its recommendations were moderate but still the Lords held out. Bentham added his great influence to reform. In the end it was not until 1837 that the death penalty was substantially reduced but by 1861,it was imposed in the case of only four offences \u2013 treason, murder, piracy and arson in the dock yards. Other changes reflected the humanitarian influence:- In 1814 the sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering for treason was modified to remove the cutting down and disembowelling. Only in 1870 was quartering formally abolished; in 1815 the pillory was abolished for some offences and, finally, altogether in 1837; in 1820 the whipping of females was abolished;in 1822 the practice of dissecting the bodies of murderers was done away with; in  1857 transportation was abolished;in 1872 the last offender was placed in the stocks. But one medieval inhumanity lingered after the death penalty was reduced. This was the public execution, at which up to 100,000 might attend. Public executions were not finally abolished until 1868.\u000aPrison reformIn the 18th century, prisons were, in the words of Henry Fielding, \u2018sewers of idleness\u2019. Prisons were farmed out to private persons whose object was simply to make a profit. \u201cWomen were thrown in the same common ward as men; first offenders with hardened recidivists; inoffensive civil debtors with muggers... ten year old boys with homosexual rapists\u201d.Hughes, R: "The Fatal Shore", page 38 Pan, 1987 The leading reformer was John Howard (prison reformer) whose great work, The State of Prisons in England and WalesHoward, J: "The State of Prisons in England and Wales". Retrieved on April 26, 2009 with preliminary observations and an account of some foreign prisons was published in 1777. Howard was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and was shocked by the horrors of prison life and the callousness of gaolers. Not only were gaols indescribably dirty but were so overcrowded that great numbers of prisoners died each year from gaol fever.In his work, Howard argued that prisons should be sanitary and secure. The keeper should be the paid servant of Justices. There should be separate cells for sleeping, in order to break down the corruption that came from the random aggregation of prisoners. Prisoners should have useful work to do in proper workshops. Romilly, then a young man, was greatly influenced by Howard. Writing to a friend John Roget in 1781 he said of Howard, \u201c the author .. made a visit to every prison and house of correction in England with invincible perseverance and courage; for some of the prisons were so infected by diseases and putrid air that he was obliged to hold a cloth steeped in vinegar to his nostrils .. and to change his clothes the moment he returned. After having devoted so much time to his painful employment here, he set out on a tour through a great part of Holland, Germany and Switzerland to visit their prisons\u2026\u201d.From the 1770s to 1791 statutes were enacted designed to give effect to Howard\u2019s views and proposals but the Justices responsible for their implementation failed to do so. It was not until Peel\u2019s Gaol Act of 1823 that a foundation was laid for a humane prison system.After Howard\u2019s death in 1790 the leading reformer was Elizabeth Fry (1780\u20131845) who began visiting Newgate, which was particularly infamous for its treatment of women prisoners. She arranged for food and clothing and with material she provided taught them how to make clothes.Prison reform has had many vicissitudes. Some of the early theories of reform with their emphasis on solitary confinement in reaction to the 18th century congregating of prisoners, were erroneous. Nevertheless, the great divide in prison reform is, without question, the humanitarian reforms of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\u000aAbolition of tortureTorture which had been permitted by law and implemented throughout continental Europe, was abolished in every European country throughout the 18th century. This achievement was the work of the Enlightenment: Beccaria and Voltaire being the leaders.By the 12th and 13th centuries primitive modes of trial were breaking down. Proof of guilt had been established by magical means such as the Ordeal.The four kinds of Ordeal were as follows: (a)Ordeal of hot iron. The accused had to carry a hot iron in his hand for nine steps. His hand was then bound up. If, when uncovered on the third day, it festered he was guilty;if healthy,he was innocent. (b) Ordeal of hot water was carried out along similar lines to Ordeal by hot iron; (c) Ordeal of cold water. The accused was thrown into water. If he floated he was guilty. If he sank he was innocent. This particular form of Ordeal was associated with the offence of witchcraft; (d) Ordeal of Morsel. This consisted of giving the accused a piece of bread or cheese, one ounce in weight, which was adjured to stick in his mouth if he was guilty. If it went down he was innocent At the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 Pope Innocent III prohibited trial by ordeal and forbade ecclesiastics from taking part in it. New criminal procedures for determining guilt were needed. This was the precipitating cause for the use of torture on the continent. Innocent III had approved inquisitorial process in ecclesiastical courts and this now became extended to the civil jurisdiction. The essence of the inquisitorial procedure is that the trial is an inquiry to find the truth which is to be carried out by a process of interrogation. Torture was applied as a supplement to the new inquisitorial procedure. It came to be the prime method of extorting evidence. It was hardest in Germany and Italy but was also very much a feature of French law.When Becarria wrote in the 18th century on torture, rationalism combined with humanitarianism to lead in the same direction as it had regarding criminal punishments. Becarria said of torture that \u201cit to confound all relations to expect that a man should be both accuser and accused and that pain should be the test of truth, as though truth resided in the muscles and fibres of a wretch under torture.\u201d"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", Vol 22, 1959, page 314. It was, however, the deep sense of outrage throughout France which followed the case of Jean Calas that led to the abolition of torture in that country. Jean Calas had been tortured and cruelly executed \u2013 all four of his limbs being broken in two places. He was then strangled and burnt at the stake. He was accused of murdering his son, supposedly in a rage over his son\u2019s plan to convert to Catholicism. To the end he proclaimed his innocence: in fact his son had suicided. Voltaire was approached. At first Voltaire regarded the case simply as confirmation of his contempt for all Christians. If Calas were innocent, his death was an indictment of his Catholic executioners. If he were guilty it demonstrated the fanaticism of the Protestants. But soon Voltaire saw the case as much more than religious propaganda. He wanted to find the truth. Before long he had become convinced that Jean Calas had been the victim of judicial murder and he set about to rehabilitate his memory. He engaged lawyers to search out new evidence and press the authorities. He solicited funds to help the destitute Calas family. He wrote moving accounts of the case and mounted a campaign against the French legal system. Finally, three years after the execution, Jean Calas was cleared of the crime.By the late 18th century no sovereign could appear enlightened if torture were permitted within his or her dominions. In France torture was abolished by an Ordanance of 9 October 1789. Catherine II, acknowledging the influence of Voltaire and Becarria, included in the Instructions for the preparation of a Criminal Code (1776), a declaration that all punishments by which the body is maimed ought to be abolished. In Tuscany torture was abolished by the Grand Duke, Peter Leopold in 1786 largely as a result of Becarria\u2019s lucid indictment of torture and the death penalty. This was followed in other Italian states. Frederick the Great effectively abolished torture in Prussia in 1740 although this was not formalised until 1805. Other German states followed Prussia. A petition against torture was presented to the Austrian emperor by Joseph von Sonnenfels (1773\u20131817). Torture was abolished. The Austrian Netherlands (1797) and the United Provinces (1798) followed suit. Sweden had previously abolished torture in 1734. One by one other countries followed. It was a great triumph for the humanitarian movement.England followed a different course and the abolition of torture is to be attributed to different causes. When Innocent III effectively abolished Ordeal in 1215 England was not faced with the same predicament as continental Europe to find a new criminal procedure and a new mode of proof. Earlier, King Henry II (1154\u20131189) had adopted the jury as a means of resolving land disputes and then more generally. When Ordeal was abolished, English Judges who went on circuit, cast about for a new mode of trial and naturally turned to the already established process of trial by jury.But there was a difference in this procedure much more fundamental than in the kind of bodies determining guilt. The inquisitorial method on the continent was a judicial inquiry to find the truth. The English system was always accusatorial, that is, the Crown presented a case to the jury against the accused. It lay upon the Crown to prove that case. The Court\u2019s function was not to find the truth but whether the Crown had sustained the allegations it had made. In such a procedure there is no place for torture or other process to compel a confession. This was the principal reason that the common law rejected torture quite early. A further factor was that heresy was less common in England and although torture was by no means confined to heresy, it was typical of such an inquiry. But it was only the common law that gave effect to this prohibition and it was only in the common law courts, where the accusatorial mode prevailed, that it applied. The Crown could under its prerogative create Prerogative Courts in which the process was inquisitorial. These courts survived until the English revolution of the 17th century. Torture was used in these courts.In the 17th century there was a reaction against inquisitorial procedures. In the first instance this reaction was upon constitutional grounds in which the common law asserted paramountcy over the prerogative, but there was too a revulsion against the use of torture. This came to a head in what was almost the last case of torture in England, the case of John Felton in 1628. Felton had murdered the Duke of Buckingham and on arrest freely admitted the crime. Before trial he was brought before the Council and urged to confess who had incited him to commit the murder. He denied that anyone had done so. The report of the Council proceeding at which the King was present, is as follows:\u000a\u000a\u201cDr Laud, Bishop of London, being then at the Council Table, told him if he would not confess he must go to the rack. Felton replied, \u2018if it must be so he could not tell whom he might not nominate in the extremity of torture, and if what he should say then must go for truth, he could not tell which of their Lordships he might name for torture might draw unexpected things from him. After this he was asked no more questions but sent back to prison.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe Council then debated whether the law of the land would justify putting Felton to the rack and the King directed that before any such thing should be done the advice of the Judges should be taken. On 13 November the King formally asked the Judges whether by law Felton might not be racked \u2018and whether there was any law against it\u2019, for said the King \u2018if it might be done by law he would not use prerogative in this point\u2019. On the next day all the Judges assembled at Serjeant\u2019s Inn  Fleet street and agreed unanimously that Felton ought not to be tortured on the rack \u2018for no such punishment is known or allowed by our law\u2019. There were one or two cases of torture after this but in 1641 the Court of Star Chamber was abolished and with it torture in England.It is apparent that the abolition of torture in English law was not, as on the continent, attributable to the humanitarian movement but to the early development of conceptions of the rule of law which became embedded in the common law.\u000aThe treatment of the mentally illBedlam was the hospital for the insane in eighteenth century London. On quiet nights the noise of the confined lunatics \u201crattling in their chains and making a terrible outcry echoed across the city\u201d."Great Ages of Man, Age of Enlightenment", page 118. Time-Life. During the day the inmates were on view for curious London sightseers who paid to walk around the grounds enjoying the antics of the mad.Mitchell and Leys:"A History of the English People", page 285. Longmans, Green and Co., 1950. It was understandable therefore that William Hogarth, in his drawings of A Rake''s Progress, should have depicted Tom Rakewell as ending his days in Bedlam. What was, on the face of it surprising, was that men such as Dr Johnson and Boswell and Sir Richard Steele would have visited Bedlam. Steele, having to look after three schoolboys took them ''\u2018to see the lions, the tombs, Bedlam and other places that are entertainment for raw minds\u2019. In the final decades of the eighteenth century the Enlightenment had failed to make any significant impact on this area of inhumanity.The medieval understanding of mental abnormality was ignorant and superstitious. More than 1500 years had elapsed since the Greek doctors, under the influence of Hippocrates had examined illness as a natural process. In the case of insanity the Greeks differentiated between paranoia, dementias, hypochondrias and other mental disease. Soranus, an Alexandrian physician of the first century, carefully examined mental illness as an illness. In the fifth century St Augustine ascribed disease to demons. The behaviour of the psychotic often suggested to everyday observation that the soul is possessed by some alien force and thus because the mentally ill were thought to be afflicted by the devil they were treated by exorcism. Other treatments of a more or less benign character included shaving a cross in the person\u2019s hair or the tying of the person to the rood-screen in the church so that the mental condition might be improved by hearing Mass.The treatment of the insane in the Middle Ages was not deliberately cruel or at least not invariably so. The use of St Mary of Bethlehem hospital for the insane from the 14th century indicates a concern and \u2018Poor Mad Men of Bethlehem\u2019 received an increasing number of bequests for their maintenance from the 15th to the 17th centuries. Even in early English criminal law, \u2018 absolute madness\u2019 was a defence to an alleged crime. Theologically, the church never denied that the insane (except for certain monsters at birth) possessed a soul. But the notion of diabolical infection dominated attitudes and if \u201cthe mad proved to be troublesome they could expect to be beaten or locked up.\u201dScull, A: "The most solitary inflictions, and museums of madness: social organization of insanity in 19th century England". Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1979.The Greek spirit of rationalism survived in medieval Islam and, in regard to the insane, Muslim physicians and psychologists relied mostly upon clinical observation, not demonological explanation. The Arab physician, Najab ud-din Muhammad described a number of mental illnesses such as agitated depression and neurosis. In the 11th century the Persian physician, Avicenna, was a pioneer in neuropsychiatry and was the first to describe such conditions as hallucination, mania, melancholia, dementia, stroke and tremor.The 17th century scientific revolution in Europe influenced physiology with such notable discoveries as the circulation of the blood and the existence of microbes. It was accepted that the cause of disease was not magical or demonic. But little immediate progress was made in the field of mental illness.Foremost in bringing about humanitarian change was Dr Phillipe Pinel (1745\u20131826). Pinel was physician to Biutre prison in Paris where a large number of lunatics were kept. An incident occurring to a friend led him to his life\u2019s work. The friend suddenly lost his mental balance and, as was customary, was locked up in the asylum. He managed to escape from his cage and took refuge in the woods. A week later his body was found half devoured by wolves. Pinel decided to devote himself to the study of insanity.What then took place is described by Kenneth Walker in his The Story of Medicine: "Even in Pinel\u2019s time the insane were regarded as being deliberately malicious and many people still attributed their behaviour to their possession by a devil. If, therefore, exorcism failed, the correct treatment was to punish them for their stubbornness in clinging to evil. Pinel reacted with all his being against this medieval idea of possession for he was convinced that the insane were sick people in need of treatment."Walker, K: "The Story of Medicine". Oxford University Press, 1955 In his campaign for humane treatment of the insane he approached Couthon the leader of the Paris Commune who agreed to visit Biutre because he believed strongly in the ideal of equality of human beings. "As he tramped with his guide through the damp underground corridors of the dark prison he was greeted by the ravings and the curses of 300 mad men and was deafened by the pounding of their manacles against iron bars." Pinel insisted on his wish to set some of these patients free. Couthon, despite thinking Pinel an impractical visionary, agreed. Then came the dramatic moment when Pinel freed an English captain who had lived in chains for forty years and had, despite that, killed a prison attendant with a blow from his manacles. Pinel talked to him at length, persuading him to behave if freed. \u201cWithin the space of a few days, Pinel had the chains removed from more than fifty men who had hitherto been regarded as dangerous madmen \u2026 because they were being treated kindly they ceased to be rebellious and disorderly\u201d.Walker, K: "The Story of Medicine", pages 293\u20134. Oxford University Press, 1955. Pinel did away with the old violent methods of treatment such as bleeding, purging and blistering. He published his Trait Medico- Philosophique sur L\u2019asientation Mentale ou la Manie in 1801. It is one of the classics of psychiatry and did much to end \u2018the moral treatment of the mad\u2019.About 1800 attitudes towards the insane began to change. It became accepted that insanity was not diabolically caused but, like other disease, fell within the realm of medical explanation and medical treatment. The science of abnormal psychology was born. This in turn led to the insane being recognized as human beings in need of care and active compassion. It also led to the assumption of responsibility by the State for the provision of organized care. Shortly before the end of the 18th century the Society of Friends opened a hospital for the insane at York. It was the first in England to treat the insane with humane methods. The success of the York hospital aroused public feeling and support. Lord Shaftesbury (then Lord Ashley) set out to reform the chaotic and inhumane system of lunatic asylums which then existed. Lunacy Commissioners were to be appointed. The House of Lords obstructed the passage of the Improvement Bill but in 1828 a Bill was enacted providing for supervision by Metropolitan Commissioners.Of the humanitarians who led in this field the most prominent were the Tuke family. It was William Tuke who had in 1792 proposed the establishment of the Retreat at York under the management of Friends. His grandson, Samuel Tuke (1784\u20131857) published the very influential work in 1815, Practical hints on the Economy of Pauper Lunatic Asylums and Daniel Tuke (1827\u20131895), with J.C. Bucknill, published A Manual of Psychological MedicineTuke, S. & Bucknill, J.C: "A Manual of Psychological Medicine". retrieved on April 26, 2009 which, for a long period, was the standard work in the area.Legislation placed the care of the insane on an organized and humane basis. In England, the Lunacy Act 1890 provided that subject to a limited number of exceptions no lunatic could be lawfully detained against his will except by order of an authorised person and by law. Provision was made for asylums and for their frequent inspection. Unnecessary restraint of a lunatic was an offence.It was discovered through experience that isolation of the insane in institutions was not in fact a sound way to treat them. Successful treatment required a friendlier environment and, in some cases, involvement in the wider community. Gradually asylums were dismantled. The pejorative description \u2018lunatic\u2019 was replaced by \u2018a person of unsound mind\u2019 in 1930 and a \u2018mentally disordered person\u2019 in 1959.  The study of psychology as a field of study separate from philosophy began towards the end of the 19th century. Experimentation on mental behaviour commenced with Weber. In 1899 Emil Kraepelin identified the condition dementia praecox in which a person loses touch with reality and distinguished it from the manic depressive psychosis. From this point modern psychology developed.The twentieth century culminated in the intersection of reformist and philanthropic humanitarianism in the treatment of the insane. The rational recognition that the insane are fully human, are not diabolically controlled and manipulated and the legislative provision to protect and rehabilitate them all belong within the traditions of the humanitarian movement, combining care with reason.\u000aHumanitarianism and the treatment of women in the 19th centuryIn England, in 1800, the rights of a woman devolved upon her husband on marriage. She could not make a Will or be party to a contract or appear in court. The wife\u2019s personal chattels automatically became the property of her husband. As John Stuart Mill, writing in the 1860s said, \u201cshe could acquire no property but for him, the instant it becomes hers even if by inheritance, it becomes ipso facto his.\u201dMill, J. S: "The Subjection of Women", Chapter 2. 1869. Retrieved on April 29, 2009 The husband\u2019s authority to chastise her physically had been modified somewhat since Blackstone had written in the 18th century but she had almost no legal redress even if treated brutally. \u201c Husbands\u201d, Mill wrote,  \u201cindulge the utmost habitual excesses of bodily violence towards the unhappy wife who alone, at least of grown persons, can neither repel or escape from the brutality\u201d. For all practical purposes divorce was unobtainable. The only judicial decree available was judicial separation which left the parties married but physically separated. In that event, her husband had an almost absolute right to the custody of the children. John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst on the second reading of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 described the wife\u2019s condition on separation as \u201calmost a state of outlawry\u201d. In Mill\u2019s description a married woman was \u201cthe actual bond servant of her husband.\u201d He stated the situation of women very precisely: \u201cThe social subordination of women thus stands out as an isolated fact in modern social institutions \u2026. A single relic of an old world of thought and practice exploded in everything else. For what is the peculiar character of the modern world \u2013 the difference which clearly distinguishes modern institutions, modern social ideas, modern life itself, from those times long past? It is that human beings are no longer born to their place in life and chained down by an inexorable bond to the place they are born to, but are free to employ their faculties.\u201dMill, J.

Pimlico, 1997 Mary Wollstonecraft, then about 33, published Vindication of the Rights of Women in 1792. It was a clear and articulate rejection of the subordination of women, a protest against the assumption that \u201cwomen were only the plaything of men\u201d.Wollstoncraft, M: "Vindication of the Rights of Women". 1792. Retrieved on April 29, 2009 It was the first feminist work written and its publication caused an outcry.Just before the middle of the 19th century there was action. In 1838 the Chartists included female suffrage among their proposals. Mrs Henry Reed published A Plea for Women (1843). A spate of pamphlets demanding suffrage for women followed. In 1857 Florence Nightingale returned from the Crimea to establish the nursing profession and in the same year the Matrimonial Causes Act was passed allowing for divorce by the wife on the ground of a repeated act of adultery (the husband would be entitled in the event of a single act of adultery by the wife).In 1869 Mill published The Subjection of Women, a sustained and brilliant protest at the inequality and inhumanity of the condition in which society had placed women. The book was, as Mill had expected, ridiculed. And yet it became the philosophic base of the 19th century women\u2019s movement. Mill called for the removal of all disabilities imposed upon women and \u201cthe opening to them of all honourable employments, and the training and education which qualifies for those employments\u201d..\u201dMill, J.

But remember the date of this evening. April 6th 1867. At Westminster only one week before John Stuart Mill had seized an opportunity in one of the early debates on the Reform Bill that now was the time to given equal rights at the ballot box. His brave attempt (the motion was defeated by 196 to 73, Disraeli the old fox abstaining) was greeted with smiles from the average man, guffaws from Punch (one joke showed a group of gentlemen besieging a female Cabinet Minister, haw haw haw), and disappearing frowns from a sad majority of educated women, who maintained that their influence was best exerted from home. Nevertheless, March 30, 1867, is the point from which we can date the beginning of feminine emancipation in England.Fowles, J: "The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman", page 95. Signet. Fowles would seem to be incorrect as to precise dates but the substance is accurate. See Secker and Warburg, ed: "A Century of Family Law 1857\u20131957", page 282. Graveson. Also see Hansard 3rd Series Vol 187, Cols 817 and 825.\u000aIn 1869, the year in which Mill\u2019s work was published, Sophia Jex-Blake was given permission to attend medical lectures at Edinburgh university. Male students were furious and what became known as the \u2018Riot of Surgeon\u2019s Hill\u2019 occurred when female students were pelted with mud and sheep were ushered into the lecture theatre. Cambridge began admitting women in the 1870s. Oxford was slower but was the first to allow women to take degrees. Primary and secondary education had hitherto been denied to women but the Education Act 1870 imposed compulsory education for girls as well as boys. In 1882, with the enactment of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act married women became able to retain and own beneficially their separate property.In the fields of divorce and maintenance that the wife remained in an oppressively unequal position. So much so that the European novel of the latter part of the 19th century depicted the \u2018prison\u2019 in which the wife was confined and the tragic consequences: Anna Karenina suicides, Tess of the d''Urbevilles is executed for murder and Irene Forsyte only escapes from her unhappiness after her distracted lover is killed.Adultery was the only ground for divorce in the 1857 Act. Desertion or cruelty by the husband provided no grounds nor did his insanity. Maintenance was always difficult to obtain and for 30 years after the Divorce Act payment of maintenance would be ordered in favour of an innocent wife only so long as she remained chaste. Only in the last quarter of the twentieth century were these inequalities modified and removed. By 1950 husband and wife were in an approximate state of equality in matrimonial law.Despite Mill\u2019s pioneering work and that of others, women in England still had no vote in 1900. Certain European countries, New Zealand (1893), South Australia (1894) and Western Australia (1899) and a number of American states had allowed women to vote but not England. After John Stuart Mill\u2019s death in 1874 suffrage Bills continued to be introduced but were just as regularly defeated.The Women\u2019s Social and Political Union founded by Emmeline Pankhurst in 1903 was a militant movement. What followed was a succession of protests, more or less violent. Lloyd George\u2019s house was damaged by a bomb. Women chained themselves to Parliament, sat opposite the doorstep of 10 Downing Street and in 1906 interrupted the King\u2019s opening speech to Parliament. Pankhurst and others went to prison. Emily Davidson lost her life when she threw herself under the King\u2019s horse on Derby Day.The First World War intervened. Women rallied to the war effort becoming nurses and bus drivers. They replaced men in the factories. In 1916, Asquith overwhelmed by the evidence of feminine capacity relented and agreed to legislation. Legislation assented to on the 6th February 1918 women were granted the vote and allowed to sit in parliament and by related legislation in 1919 became entitled to hold civil and judicial office. Other western countries followed a different course but the result was similar.  It is apparent that, with the women\u2019s movement of the 19th century, the humanitarian movement for reform intersects with the human rights movement. A question arises whether it more properly falls within one or the other. The origins of each movement were more or less contemporaneous. They both depended upon natural law and the spiritual equality of human beings which that implied. They also both depended on the re-emergence of natural law upon secular foundations. The rise of natural rights involved turning natural \u2018law\u2019 in the direction of \u2018rights\u2019. It was these \u2018rights\u2019 which were relied upon in the great revolutions \u2013 English, American and French\u2014of the 17th and 18th centuries. Both also derived from natural law the paramountcy of their claims over the State and positive law.But there are differences. The humanitarian movement was concerned with \u2018wrongs\u2019. Unlike \u2018rights\u2019 the duties breached by these wrongs did not depend upon the exercise of a right by a right-holder. The duties were near-absolute. As mentioned,the humanitarian movement and human rights are closely related in the case of the women''s movement.Mary Wollstonecraft sought \u201cthe vindication of the rights of women\u201d and the \u2018right to vote\u2019, the franchise, is properly describable as a \u2018right\u2019.But when we look at the situation of women in the 19th century when the women\u2019s movement began it was not just the deprival of this or that right. Women, as a class of human beings, had been singled out and as a class were, as John Stuart Mill said, in \u2018a state of actual bondage\u2019. They had a status of subordination. Status implies that a defined class of human beings in the community has, collectively, by virtue of membership of that class, different and unequal rights. Status may as in the case of children or the insane be protective but, in other instances such as slavery or serfdom, status is a badge of inferiority. That was the position of women at the beginning of the 19th century.\u000aPrevention of cruelty to animalsBefore the 19th century cruelty to animals was quite generally indulged in for popular amusement. King Henry VIII of England was himself very fond of cock-fighting as was King James I. James appointed a special cock-master to breed and train his cocks. Sometimes a brandy was given just before a fight to provoke their spirit. In 1607 a Norfolk vicar wrote a commendation of the sport. Puritans protested but they did not do so on the ground of cruelty but because cock-fights were held on a Sunday. Cock fighting continued until well into the 19th century, often in conjunction with horse racing. As late as June 1, 1822, the Times advertised, \u201cA main of cocks will be fought on Monday 3 June at the Cockpit Royal Tyburn Street Westminster between the gentlemen of Middlesex and Shropshire for five guineas a battle and fifty guineas for the best battler\u201d.A variant of cock-fighting was the throwing of cocks in which the cock was partly buried in the ground or fastened to a stake and stoned to death.In the 17th century a special amphitheatre was built at Paris Gardens, Southwark, for bull and bear-baiting. Seating was provided for 1000 spectators. Later, a second ring was built exclusively for bear-baiting. In villages, a bear would be chained to a stake on a village green and set upon by dogs.Maltreatment of animals was due partly to cruelty and partly to indifference. Nevertheless, it was encouraged, or at least, not discouraged by European thought. The stoics who advanced European ethics so much in the idea of the spiritual equality of human beings taught that this applied only to rational creatures and thus did not apply to non-human animals. It may have been thought that the New Testament ethic of compassion would embrace animals but Saint Paul who had absorbed stoic teaching drew a clear distinction between God\u2019s concern for man and for other animals.Ulpian, a Roman jurist, who was referred to in Justinian\u2019s Code, suggested that natural law derived from instincts common to humans and animals. This \u2018unlucky\u2019 phrase, as Pollock described it, may have been influenced by the Pythagoreans who saw no division between Man and animals. His comments became incorporated into Justinian\u2019s Institutes. It was however totally out of accord with stoic teaching generally, Vinogradoff, "Common Sense in Law", page 236. Home University Library.The Pauline-stoic position was reinforced by the authority of St Augustine in the 5th century:Christ himself shows that to refrain from the killing of animals and the destroying of plants is the height of superstition for, judging that there were no common rights between us and the beasts and trees, who sent devils into swine and with a curse withered the tree on which he found no fruit.\u201d St Augustine observed that \u201cthe swine had not sinned nor had the tree.\u000aThe first writer in Europe to condemn cruelty to animals as a wrong in itself was the French essayist, Montaigne (1533\u20131599). In his essay on Cruelty, he wrote that \u201cwe have a general duty to be humane to animals\u201d and it is a presumption that man \u201cwithdraws and separates himself from the crowd of other creatures\u201d. In the 18th century David Hume argued that human intelligence and animal intelligence functioned in the same way. He said that \u201cwe should be bound by the laws of humanity to give gentle usage to those creatures\u201d. It was not a matter of mere justice. It is not, Hume said, \u201cthe cautious, jealous virtue of justice\u201d but humanity. Hume led to Bentham. More than anyone else it was Bentham and his philosophy and active persistence that resulted in a changed attitude towards animals. \u201c The question\u201d said Bentham in his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, \u201cis not, can they reason? Nor, can they talk? But, can they suffer?\u201dIn 1811, Lord Erskine (1750\u20131823) in a speech before the House of Lords, portrayed the cruelties inflicted upon animals and asked for protective legislation. In 1821, Richard Martin, a land-owner in Galway, proposed a law to prevent the ill-treatment of horses. The Bill was laughed out of the Commons. In the next year he secured passage of the Ill-treatment of Cattle Bill. It prohibited the cruel treatment of cattle and provided for the imposition of a fine of 5 pounds or imprisonment for 3 months for any person who wantonly and cruelly beat, abused or ill-treated any horse, mare, ox,sheep or other cattle.There was however nobody to enforce the legislation. On 16 June 1824 Martin and a number of other humanitarians formed a society which had as its immediate purpose the gathering of evidence of the maltreatment of animals. Among the first members were the evangelicals William Wilberforce and Thomas Fowell Buxton. This Society later became the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, being designated \u2018Royal\u2019 by Queen Victoria in 1840.It was the leader in campaigns against brutal sports, experimentation and other forms of cruelty to animals and it became active in the prevention of cruelty to children and the enactment of Prevention of Cruelty to Children legislation in 1884.The Animal Prevention Society campaigned for improved prevention of cruelty to animals legislation building on the 1822 Act. In 1849 the Cruelty to Animals Act imposed forfeiture and penalties for the ill-treatment of animals. This law, together with the 1854 amendment, became the foundation of future legislation in England and the model for other common law countries. In 1876, further legislation extended the Cruelty to Animals Act to experimentation upon animals for scientific purposes, where the animal is alive and the experiments are calculated to inflict pain. Subsequent legislation regulated vivisection requiring it to take place at a registered place and for an approved purpose.What Bentham had initiated and the humanitarian movement had achieved was more than legislation. Over the course of the next century there was a revolution in social attitudes to the treatment of animals throughout the European world. Henceforward cruelty to animals would occur but it was never defended.\u000aHumanitarianism internationally\u000aFormation of the Red Cross and international humanitarian actionThe formation of the Red Cross (The International Committee of the Red Cross) in 1863 to alleviate suffering resulting from war was almost the beginning  of organized compassion internationally. The Red Cross was also largely responsible for developing the other strand of international humanitarianism, the birth of international humanitarian law.Humanitarian action internationally had though already been evident in the progressive abolition of slavery during the 18th and 19th centuries. After abolition of the slave trade in Great Britain (1807), British cruisers intercepted foreign slave ships to prevent the trade. In 1885 the Treaty of Berlin forbade slave trading. Later, at the beginning of the 20th century, the world collectively denounced King Leopold II\u2019s "Heart of Darkness"Joseph Conrad, "Heart of Darkness". Wordsworth Classics, 1995 first published 1902. in the Congo and, as mentioned, international pressure forced him to yield his personal control. In 1926 the Slavery Convention confirmed that states had jurisdiction to punish slavers wherever apprehended.The Crimean War (1854\u20131856) was the first European war for forty years. The British Army went to Crimea without a medical corps or medical service. In the barracks hospital at Scutari the spread of cholera, gangrene and dysentry raged uncontrolled. William Howard Russell of The Times, the first modern war correspondent, described the conditions. 25,000 lives had been lost. Public opinion was aroused. The Secretary for War persuaded Florence NightingaleMoorehead, C: "Dunant\u2019s Dream", pages 29\u201332. Carroll and Graf Publishers Inc, New York. who had administered a sanatarium in London to organize a corps of nurses to go to the Crimea. She did so and brought the death rate down by 40%. Her nursing corps became the foundation of modern nursing.Attention became focused on the plight of the wounded. A terrible battle took place at Solferino in 1859 during the campaign by France and Piedmont against the Austrian empire. 300,000 soldiers fought; 6000 were killed and 30,000 were wounded in 15 hours. The wounded lay deserted because the retreating Austrians had taken all the carts and horses. A young Swiss banker, Henri Dunant witnessed the scene. As he later described it, \u201cthe wounded lay for days on the battlefield, bleeding to death, tormented by thirst, hunger, flies and the burning heat.\u201d He saw the dead thrown into huge pits and was told some of the men were still alive when buried. Castiglione, the little town to where the wounded were eventually taken, was overwhelmed. The whole town had become a temporary hospital.After returning home, Dunant recorded his experiences and in October 1862, published, at his own expense, A Memory to Solferino. Dunant did not suggest that what had happened was due in any way to lack of compassion but simply that there was no organization to cope. In the last pages of the work, he put forward the idea which led to the formation of the Red Cross. "It should be possible\u201d he said "to form a society in every country when nations are at peace, from which men and women would be organized and trained so that they could give aid to the wounded in times of war\u201d. He also proposed that some international principles be codified to regulate the treatment of the wounded in future wars and which would stipulate that friend and foe should receive equal treatment.These proposals were taken up by Gustave Moynier, a Swiss lawyer, of great energy, who formed a five man committee with himself as chairman and Dunant as secretary. As a result of their efforts representatives of 16 European states met in Geneva on the 16th October 1863 and formally established the Red Cross.See Moorehead, C: "Dunant\u2019s Dream", pages 20\u201322 and page 128. Carroll and Graf Publishers Inc. where Moorehead also describes Dunant\u2019s reclusive decline and his revival of fortune before the end of the century, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize in 1901; see also Robertson, G: "Crimes against Humanity", page 20. Penguin Books, 2006.It proceeded to propose an international convention for the care of the wounded. A Convention for the Amelioration of the condition of armies in the Field was adopted in 1864 and within three years was ratified by 21 nations. It specified that all wounded be accorded humane treatment, that medical personnel, whether military or civilian volunteers, should be considered neutral and that anybody helping the wounded should be \u2018respected and remain free\u2019 and that personnel should wear the Red Cross on a White background. Red Cross societies multiplied. Amelioration, in the words of the first Geneva Convention, has remained the Red Cross\u2019s core function. In the first world war alone it transmitted two and a half million letters for prisoners of war. It re-united families who had been fighting. It arranged for the accommodation in neutral countries of sick and wounded combatants and for their subsequent repatriation. It visited the internment camps of all the warring parties and, after the war, was responsible for repatriating 450,000 prisoners of war from Central Europe and Russia.In the many wars since, the Red Cross has performed a host of relief and welfare tasks. It was again providing assistance to the wounded, the sick and the prisoners-of-war in the Second World War. There was now a new dimension. The world was stunned by the number of civilians killed or injured in the Second World War. The number killed was a staggering 24 million. Millions of people scattered throughout Europe were homeless. After the second world war Europe \u201cwas faced with a tidal wave of refugees\u2019.Hobsbawm, E: "Age of Extremes,The Short History of the Twentieth Century,1914\u20131991", page 51. The Penguin Group, 1994. There were 9 million displaced persons in Germany alone, living in overcrowded conditions. The United Nations Refugee Relief Administration (UNRRA) was established to help them and assist in their resettlement. Slowly they were dispersed to Australia, Canada the United States and other countries. Non-Government organizations such as Oxfam, formed during the war to alleviate distress in Greece, Save the Children and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res have, together with the Red Cross, carried forward the humanitarian impulse in this field.The international protection of refugees hardly existed before the First World War. Russians fleeing the Bolshevik Revolution and Armenians fleeing the Turks faced difficulty in proving identity but also there was no internationally agreed definition of  \u2018refugee\u2019. Two early treaties of a limited character were entered into during the thirties, one specifically directed to refugees from Germany. The aftermath of the Second World War made the problem of refugees more urgent. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established in January 1951 and, in July of that year, the Status of Refugees ConventionO\u2019Connell, D.P: "International Law, Vol 2", pages 740,741. Stevens. was opened for signature and ratification. It defined a \u2018refugee\u2019 as \u201c a person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself for the protection of that country: or, who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it\u201d. A refugee cannot be returned or sent to a country where he or she may be persecuted.Humanitarianism is particularly used to describe the thinking and doctrines behind emergency response to humanitarian crises. In such cases it argues for a humanitarian response based on humanitarian principles, particularly the principle of humanity. Nicholas de Torrente, Executive Director of MSF-USA writes:\u000a\u000a&#34;The most important principles of humanitarian action are humanity, which posits the conviction that all people have equal dignity by virtue of their membership in humanity, impartiality, which directs that assistance is provided based solely on need, without discrimination among recipients, neutrality, which stipulates that humanitarian organizations must refrain from taking part in hostilities or taking actions that advantage one side of the conflict over another, and independence, which is necessary to ensure that humanitarian action only serves the interests of war victims, and not political, religious, or other agendas.\u000aThese fundamental principles serve two essential purposes. They embody humanitarian action\u2019s single-minded purpose of alleviating suffering, unconditionally and without any ulterior motive. They also serve as operational tools that help in obtaining both the consent of belligerents and the trust of communities for the presence and activities of humanitarian organizations, particularly in highly volatile contexts.&#34;\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Red Cross and the Geneva ConventionsThe Red Cross became the leading inspiration in the regulation by international law of the conduct of war in a humane way. The international conventions protecting the wounded and sick members of armed forces on land (1864) and sea (1906) and prisoners-of-war (1929) were replaced by the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 which supplemented and continued to provide the framework for regulating conduct in war.The first and second Geneva Conventions provide for the humane care of sick and wounded combatants on land and sea without discrimination. Immunity is to be granted to hospitals, medical personnel and army chaplains and also to hospital ships. Provision was made for recognition of the Red Cross emblem. The third convention protects prisoners-of-war and in doing so revises the 1929 convention in the light of the second world war experience. Use of prisoners of war for military labour, for medical experiments or as objects of public insult or curiosity is forbidden. All prisoners-of-war are immune from prosecution for their behaviour as combatants unless they committed war crimes. Torture or any form of coercion to extract information are absolutely prohibited. The fourth Geneva Convention was new. It provides for the protection of civilian persons in time of war. Its aim is to secure the humane treatment of persons in occupied territories. They are entitled to respect for their customs and religion and particularly for their family ties. Women are guaranteed protection from rape and forced prostitution. Civilians must not be used as hostages or for reprisals; nor may they be used for forced labour or subject to mass deportation. Article 3 (common Article 3) is common to all conventions. It prohibits murder, hostage-taking, \u2018outrages upon personal dignity\u2019 and extrajudicial executions. In 1977 additional protocols sought to apply protection to armed conflict not of an international character.Robertson, G: "Crimes against Humanity", pages 206\u2013216. Penguin Books, 2006.International humanitarian law has proceeded through a number of stages. These overlap. Originally, it was integrally bound up with \u2018war\u2019 but gradually it has become an independent field of legal control on humanitarian grounds.\u000aThe means and methods of warThe Geneva Conventions were concerned with war and, at least at their inception, with the protection of those engaged in war. Subsequently, in the fourth convention of 1949, they included the protection of civilians from the consequences of war.Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded  and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field,Geneva,UNTS,Vol.75,p.31; Convention relative to the treatment of Prisoners of War, Geneva, UNTS,Vol.75,P.135; Convention for the Amelioration of the condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked members of the Armed Forces at Sea, Geneva, UNTS,Vol.75,p.85;Convention relative to the Treatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War,Geneva,UNTS,Vol.75, p.287 A second strand of international humanitarian law, also initially related to war, sought to prescribe the means by which war might be conducted. Early steps in the evolution of this strand had begun in the latter part of the 19th century, following the American Civil and Crimean wars, and prompted by fear of the loss of life and destruction caused by considerable improvements in weaponry. These efforts came together in the Hague Convention (1907).Convention concerning Laws and Customs of War on Land, The Hague, Cd 5030 They were based upon two principles: that war should be restricted to combatants and any means adopted which offended that principle should be proscribed [This ancient principle had been articulated by Honore Bonet in the 15th century and was based upon the proposition that war was a relation between state and state and not between man and man]; second was the principle that the means to attain victory in war were not unlimited. This negative proscription became increasingly important as new weapons with increasing destructiveness were invented and developed. The inter-war period consolidated these developments but initiated only the proscription of poison gas (1925). The attempt to control the aerial bombing of civilians was unsuccessful.\u000aThe Nuremberg TribunalBetween November 1945 and October 1946, 22 high ranking Nazis were tried at Nuremberg before an International Military Tribunal. This had been established by an Agreement in London (the London Agreement) in August 1945 by the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and France. The Charter of the 8th August 1945,which established the Tribunal specified in Article 6 the offences to be tried. It distinguished between \u2018war crimes\u2019, i.e. violations of the laws and customs of war (which included maltreatment of the civilian population in occupied territories), and \u2018crimes against humanity\u2019.\u2018Crimes against humanity\u2019 were defined as \u2018murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated.\u201dThe International Military Tribunal, Charter, 8 August 1945;D.P. O\u2019 Connell,International Law, 2nd Edit,Stevens,Vol 2.p.743In its judgement the Tribunal said of the London Charter that \u201cit is the expression of international law existing at the time of its (the Tribunal\u2019s) creation.Michael R. Marrus, The Nuremberg War Crimes Trial 1945-46, A Documentary History,p. 229 The \u2018Martens clause\u2019 in the Hague Convention 1907 extended to the protection of \u201cthe principles of the laws of nations as established by and prevailing among civilized nations, by the laws of humanity, and the demands of public conscience\u201d.The laws of humanity were thus woven into customary international law: when denouncing the massacre of the Armenians in 1915, the allied governments accused the Turkish government of being responsible for \u2018crimes against humanity and civilization\u201d.Nevertheless, the articulation of \u2018crimes of humanity\u2019 as a distinct category of offence expressly differentiated from \u2018war crimes\u2019 was a new development. Crimes could be committed by governments or approved by governments and these could occur \u2018before or during the war\u2019. The Nuremberg Tribunal did not however sever the link with war completely. Although the conduct might have taken place before the war, it needed to be connected with another specified crime within the jurisdiction of the tribunal i.e. a \u2018war crime\u2019 or \u2018crime against peace\u2019. However, in what became known as the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials of the Doctors, Judges and lesser officials, the Law of the Control Council, which established these tribunals, allowed for trials of crimes against humanity committed before and unconnected with the war and jurisdiction was exercised in regard to offences not linked to the war.In December 1946 the United Nations General Assembly confirmed that the Nuremberg Charter and the reasoning of the Tribunal reflected the principles of international law. The Genocide Convention 1948 finally severed this aspect of international humanitarian law from \u2018war crimes\u2019 and from the need for a link with war.See D.P.O\u2019Connell op.cit.pp745,746The Genocide Convention 1948 made genocide an offence under international law. It is capable of being committed at any time, including times of peace. The offence is constituted by conduct committed with the intention, to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.The Convention was ratified by a large number of states and now, independently of treaty, forms part of customary international law.Robertson, Crimes against Humanity, 2nd edit, pp.244\u2013246\u000aThe International Criminal CourtOn the 17 July 1998 an International Conference at Rome adopted the Rome Statute for the establishment of an International Criminal Court.Robertson.op.cit.pp682\u2013694 This followed many years of negotiation and discussion. The final vote was 120 in favour, 21 abstentions and 7 opposed.The Statute came into force on the July 1, 2002 after the 60th state had ratified it. This was in fact quite speedy as each ratifying state had first to enact domestic legislation in accordance with the Statute. By 2008 more than 100 states have become parties to the Statute. Notable non-parties are the United States, China and Israel. Nevertheless, the degree of international consensus is such that the offences specified reflect customary international law.In a single instrument the Statute sets out definitively \u201cthe most serious crimes\u201d internationally: \u201cgenocide\u201d, \u201cwar crimes\u201d and \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. It also includes the \u201ccrime of aggression\u201d which will become operative when defined in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Statute.The Statute consolidates many of the concepts of international humanitarian law. \u201cGenocide\u201d is defined in the same terms as in the Genocide Convention 1948.  The \u201cwar crimes\u201d specified draw upon and incorporate the provisions of the Geneva Conventions. \u201cCrimes against humanity\u201d are constituted by the following \u2018acts\u2019: murder; extermination; enslavement; deportation or forcible transfer of population; imprisonment; torture; rape; enforced prostitution; forced pregnancy; enforced sterilisation; persecution on ethnic, racial, religious or other discriminatory grounds; the enforced disappearance of persons and apartheid. But these \u2018acts\u2019 will only constitute \u2018crimes against humanity\u201d when \u201ccommitted as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack.\u201d No person is to be exempt for responsibility for these crimes because he or she was a head of state or held some other official position.The Court is an independent, international body. It may however only exercise its jurisdiction where the relevant national court is unable or unwilling to proceed.\u000aThe right of humanitarian intervention - responsibility to protectAn inchoate development in the 19th century from the humanitarian impulse was the international right of humanitarian intervention. The right presupposed that a state or number of states could intervene in another state to prevent permitted, inhumane behaviour of a gross kind. It was inchoate and undeveloped because it was inconsistent with the axiomatic principle of international law \u2013 state sovereignty. Each state was sovereign within its territory and external intervention, without its concurrence, violated international law.Nevertheless, suggestions of such a right go back to Grotius and Vattel in the 17th century. William Ewart Gladstone secured parliamentary approval to send ships to protect Christians from slaughter by Turks in Bulgaria in the late 19th century. In 1898 the United States declared war on Spain because its oppressive rule in Cuba \u201cshocked the conscience of mankind.\u201d And in his State of the Union address in 1904, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt claimed the right and duty to intervene in the case of crimes committed \u201con a vast scale\u201d.Robertson, op.cit.p.19There were, however, clear difficulties in carving out an exception to the principle of sovereignty without undermining the rule of non-intervention. It was difficult to define with precision the degree of inhumanity which would justify intervention or to decide who could determine that.The issue arose acutely because of the shame felt by the international community over the failure to take any action to prevent the massacre of the Tutsis by the Hutu in Rwanda (1994). The right of intervention was invoked in the Kosovo War when Serbs sought to use terror to drive the ethnic majority from their homeland. Consideration of the right under international law at this time required that it be consistent with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Article 2 (4) of the Charter provided that \u201call members shall refrain in their national relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\u201d Chapter VII of the Charter permitted the Security Council to authorise the use of force in the case of \u201ca threat to international peace and security\u201d.It was in this context that between 14 and 16 September 2005 a United Nations Summit brought together 170 countries  to discuss the question. The concept was re-named \u2013 \u2018the right to humanitarian intervention\u2019 being replaced by \u201cthe responsibility to protect\u201d. It was agreed that \u201c each individual state has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\u201d.

It is a biological concept and is important in population ecology, differentiated from emigration and migration.\u000aStatisticsThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) said there are more than 200 million migrants around the world today. Europe hosted the largest number of immigrants, with 70.6 million people in 2005, the latest year for which figures are available. North America, with over 45.1 million immigrants, is second, followed by Asia, which hosts nearly 25.3 million. Most of today''s migrant workers come from Asia.Rich world needs more foreign workers: report, FOXNews.com, December 02, 2008 The United Nations estimates that there are 214 million migrants across the globe, an increase of about 37% in two decades."Global Migration: A World Ever More on the Move". The New York Times. June 25, 2010.The United Nations found that, in 2005, there were nearly 191 million international migrants worldwide, 3 percent of the world population. This represented a rise of 26 million since 1990. Sixty percent of these immigrants were now in developed countries, an increase on 1990. Those in less developed countries stagnated, mainly because of a fall in refugees.{{PDF}}. United Nations. Key Findings. Retrieved on 30 October 2009. Contrast that to the average rate of globalization (the proportion of cross-border trade in all trade), which exceeds 20 percent. The numbers of people living outside their country of birth is expected to rise in the future.{{cite web}}The Middle West, some parts of Europe, small areas of South West Asia, and a few spots in the East Indies have the highest percentages of immigrant population recorded by the UN Census 2005. The reliability of immigrant censuses is, however, lamentably low due to the concealed character of undocumented labor migration. The International Organization for Migration has estimated the number of foreign migrants to be over 200 million worldwide today.Global Estimates and Trends. International Organization for Migration. 2008. Retrieved on 30 October 2009.Recent surveys by Gallup found roughly 700 million adults would like to migrate to another country permanently if they had the chance. The United States is the top desired destination country."700 Million Worldwide Desire to Migrate Permanently". Gallup.com. \u000aUnderstanding of immigration\u000aGeneral theories behind immigrationOne theory of immigration distinguishes between push factors and pull factors.See the NIDI/Eurostat push and pull study for details and examples: http://www.nidi.knaw.nl/web/html/pushpull/index.html Push factors refer primarily to the motive for emigration from the country of origin. In the case of economic migration (usually labour migration), differentials in wage rates are prominent. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value of wages in one\u2019s native country, he or she may choose to migrate as long as the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic expansion of the U.S. increased immigrant flow, and in effect, nearly 20% of the population was foreign born versus today\u2019s values of 10%, making up a significant amount of the labor force. Poor individuals from less developed countries can have far higher standards of living in developed countries than in their originating countries. The cost of emigration, which includes both the explicit costs, the ticket price, and the implicit cost, lost work time and loss of community ties, also play a major role in the pull of emigrants away from their native country. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 1700s, but around the time of the 1900s it took a mere 8 days.Boustan, Leah. "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 Jan. 2009. When the opportunity cost is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher. Escape from poverty (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push factor, the availability of jobs is the related pull factor. Natural disasters and can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. This kind of migration may be illegal immigration in the destination country (emigration is also illegal in some countries, such as North Korea, Myanmar, and Somalia).The main problem with push-and-pull theories is three-fold: first, they state the obvious (i.e., people from poorer places will seek to go to richer ones); second, they are unable to explain the emergence of migrant flows (if push and pull were the only things in existence, people from the poorest countries would migrate to the richest ones, when in reality such flows are well-nigh non-existent); third, they are unable to explain the stability of the emerging patterns of migration (i.e., once a flow from country A to country B is established, it will stay on for a relatively long time, even if the initial conditions that had given the push and pull to the migration are not there any more (as the case of the German case of the Gastarbeiter, or guest worker program shows.{{Citation needed}}Emigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment: religious missionaries, and employees of transnational corporations, international non-governmental organizations and the diplomatic service expect, by definition, to work ''overseas''. They are often referred to as ''expatriates'', and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those applying in the host country (for similar work).For some migrants, education is the primary pull factor (although most international students are not classified as immigrants). Retirement migration from rich countries to lower-cost countries with better climate, is a new type of international migration. Examples include immigration of retired British citizens to Spain or Italy and of retired Canadian citizens to the U.S. (mainly to the U.S. states of Florida and Texas).Non-economic push factors include persecution (religious and otherwise), frequent abuse, bullying, oppression, ethnic cleansing and even genocide, and risks to civilians during war. Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows\u2014to escape dictatorship for instance.Some migration is for personal reasons, based on a relationship (e.g. to be with family or a partner), such as in family reunification or transnational marriage (especially in the instance of a gender imbalance). In a few cases, an individual may wish to emigrate to a new country in a form of transferred patriotism. Evasion of criminal justice (e.g. avoiding arrest) is a personal motivation. This type of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or find other loopholes to evade detection. There have been cases, for example, of those who might be guilty of war crimes disguising themselves as victims of war or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country. Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support network, and culture. They also need to liquidate their assets often at a large loss, and incur the expense of moving. When they arrive in a new country this is often with many uncertainties including finding work, where to live, new laws, new cultural norms, language or accent issues, possible racism and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family. These barriers act to limit international migration (scenarios where populations move en masse to other continents, creating huge population surges, and their associated strain on infrastructure and services, ignore these inherent limits on migration.)The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues, such as national security, terrorism, and in western Europe especially, with the presence of Islam as a new major religion. Those with security concerns cite the 2005 civil unrest in France that point to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy as an example of the value conflicts arising from immigration of Muslims in Western Europe. Because of all these associations, immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.{{Citation needed}}\u000aRegion-specific factors for immigrationAs a principle, citizens of one member nation of the European Union are allowed to work in other member nations with little to no restriction on movement.{{cite web}} This is aided by the EURES network which brings together the European Commission and the public employment services of the countries belonging to the European Economic Area and Switzerland. For non-EU-citizen permanent residents in the EU, movement between EU-member states is considerably more difficult. After new waves of accession to the European Union, earlier members have often introduced measures to restrict participation in "their" labour markets by citizens of the new EU-member states. For instance, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain each restricted their labour market for up to seven years both in the 2004 and 2007 round of accession.See, e.g., EU Enlargement in 2007: No Warm Welcome for Labor Migrants, by Catherine Drew and Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, Institute for Public Policy Research Due to the European Union''s\u2014in principle\u2014single internal labour market policy, countries such as Italy and the Republic of Ireland that have seen relatively low levels of labour immigration until recently (and which have often sent a significant portion of their population overseas in the past) are now seeing an influx of immigrants from EU countries with lower per capita annual earning rates, triggering nationwide immigration debates.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}Spain, meanwhile, is seeing growing illegal immigration from Africa. As Spain is the closest EU member nation to Africa\u2014Spain even has two autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla) on the African continent, as well as an autonomous community (the Canary Islands) west of North Africa, in the Atlantic\u2014it is physically easiest for African emigrants to reach. This has led to debate both within Spain and between Spain and other EU members. Spain has asked for border control assistance from other EU states; the latter have responded that Spain has brought the wave of African illegals on itself by granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of immigrants.{{cite news}}The United Kingdom, France and Germany have seen major immigration since the end of World War II and have been debating the issue for decades. Foreign workers were brought in to those countries to help rebuild after the war, and many stayed. Political debates about immigration typically focus on statistics, the immigration law and policy, and the implementation of existing restrictions.{{cite web}}{{cite news}} In some European countries the debate in the 1990s was focused on asylum seekers, but restrictive policies within the European Union, as well as a reduction in armed conflict in Europe and neighboring regions, have sharply reduced asylum seekers.{{cite news}}Some states, such as Japan, have opted for technological changes to increase profitability (for example, greater automation), and designed immigration laws specifically to prevent immigrants from coming to, and remaining within, the country. However, globalization, as well as low birth rates and an aging work force, has forced Japan to reconsider its immigration policy.{{cite web}} Japan''s colonial past has also created considerable number of non-Japanese in Japan. Many of these groups, especially Chinese and Koreans, have faced extreme levels of discrimination in Japan.{{cite web}}In the United States political debate on immigration has flared repeatedly since the US became independent.{{Citation needed}} Some on the far-left of the political spectrum attribute anti-immigration rhetoric to an all-"white", under-educated and parochial minority of the population, ill-educated about the relative advantages of immigration for the US economy and society.see, e.g., http://cmd.princeton.edu/papers/POM_0408.pdf or http://cmd.princeton.edu/files/POM_june2007.pdf  While this mentality shows an obvious bias, it is often hard for civil discussion to occur regarding immigration due to its highly emotional underpinnings.\u000aEconomic migrant{{See also}}\u000aThe term economic migrant refers to someone who has emigrated from one region to another region for the purposes of seeking employment or improved financial position. An economic migrant is distinct from someone who is a refugee fleeing persecution. An economic migrant can be someone from the United States immigrating to the UK or vice versa.Many countries have immigration and visa restrictions that prohibit a person entering the country for the purposes of gaining work without a valid work visa. Persons who are declared an economic migrant can be refused entry into a country.The World Bank estimates that remittances totaled $420 billion in 2009, of which $317 billion went to developing countries.Remittance Prices Worldwide. The World Bank Group.\u000aEthicsAlthough freedom of movement is often recognized as a civil right, the freedom only applies to movement within national borders: it may be guaranteed by the constitution or by human rights legislation. Additionally, this freedom is often limited to citizens and excludes others. No state currently allows full freedom of movement across its borders, and international human rights treaties do not confer a general right to enter another state. According to Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to leave or enter a country, along with movement within it (internal migration).{{cite web}} Some argue that the freedom of movement both within and between countries is a basic human right, and that the restrictive immigration policies, typical of nation-states, violate this human right of freedom of movement.Theresa Hayter, Open Borders: The Case Against Immigration Controls, London: Pluto Press, 2000. Such arguments are common among anti-state ideologies like anarchism and libertarianism.  As philosopher and "Open Borders" activist Jacob Appel has written, "Treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the opposite side of a national boundary, is hard to justify under any mainstream philosophical, religious or ethical theory."The Ethical Case for an Open Immigration Policy  Where immigration is permitted, it is typically selective. Ethnic selection, such as the White Australia policy, has generally disappeared, but priority is usually given to the educated, skilled, and wealthy. Less privileged individuals, including the mass of poor people in low-income countries, cannot avail themselves of the legal and protected immigration opportunities offered by wealthy states. This inequality has also been criticized as conflicting with the principle of equal opportunities, which apply (at least in theory) within democratic nation-states. The fact that the door is closed for the unskilled, while at the same time many developed countries have a huge demand for unskilled labour, is a major factor in undocumented immigration. The contradictory nature of this policy\u2014which specifically disadvantages the unskilled immigrants while exploiting their labour\u2014has also been criticized on ethical grounds.Immigration polices which selectively grant freedom of movement to targeted individuals are intended to produce a net economic gain for the host country. They can also mean net loss for a poor donor country through the loss of the educated minority\u2014the brain drain. This can exacerbate the global inequality in standards of living that provided the motivation for the individual to migrate in the first place. An example of the ''competition for skilled labour'' is active recruitment of health workers by First World countries, from the Third World.\u000aBy country\u000aAustraliaThe overall level of immigration to Australia has grown substantially during the last decade.

Citizens from the European Union make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Spain. They mainly come from countries like the UK and Germany, but the British case is of special interest due to its magnitude. The British authorities estimate that the British population in Spain at 700,000.{{cite web}}\u000aMid- and long term EU demographics indicate a shortage of skilled laborers on a scale that would endanger economic growth and the stability of numerous industries. For this reason the European Union launched an initiative called the EU Blue Card, In 2009. The EU Blue Card is initially a temporary residence and work permit. However it will offer holders the opportunity to apply for a permanent resident permit after working on a EU Blue Card for two to five years uninterrupted, depending on individual member state regulations. In the years ahead, EU member states will gradually accept applications for EU Blue Card. Crucial in the application process is a job contract with an EU-based organization. To facilitate this requirement the European Commission launched the EU Blue Card Database in January 2010.

As of 2009, the foreign born population origin of Italy was subdivided as follows: Europe (53.5%), Africa (22.3%), Asia (15.8%), the Americas (8.1%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of foreign born population is largely uneven in Italy: 87.3% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 12.8% live in the southern half of the peninsula.

From 1850 to 1930, the foreign born population of the United States increased from 2.2 million to 14.2 million. The highest percentage of foreign born people in the United States were found in this period, with the peak in 1890 at 14.7%. During this time, the lower costs of Atlantic Ocean travel in time and fare made it more advantageous for immigrants to move to the U.S. than in years prior. From 1880 to 1924, over 25 million Europeans migrated to the United States.

To the east of Ireland is Great Britain, separated from it by the Irish Sea. The Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island. Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, covers the remainder and is located in the northeast of the island. Relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain epitomise Ireland''s geography with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, a product of its mild but changeable oceanic climate, which avoids extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the 1600s. Today, it is the most deforested area in Europe.{{cite book}} Twenty-six mammal species are native to Ireland, with some, such as the red fox, hedgehog and badger, being very common. Others, like the Irish hare, red deer, and pine marten are less so.The population of Ireland is estimated to be 6.2 million. Slightly less than 4.5 million are estimated to live in the Republic of Ireland and slightly fewer than 1.8 million are estimated to live in Northern Ireland.The 2008 population of the Republic of Ireland was estimated to be 4,422,100 and that of Northern Ireland was estimated to be 1,775,000. The 2009 estimate for the Republic of Ireland is 4,459,300 persons. An official 2009 estimate for Northern Ireland has not yet been prepared. These estimates from the official governmental statistics agencies in the respective jurisdictions:\u000a This is a significant increase from a modern historical low of 4.2 million in the 1960s but still much lower than the peak population of over 8 million in the mid-19th century prior to the Great Famine.{{cite web}}A Norman invasion in the Middle Ages gave way to English domination by the 1500s. In the 1600s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Roman Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 1700s. In 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century led to the partition of the island, creating the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades. Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom and saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following a political agreement in 1998. In 1973, both parts of Ireland joined the European Community. The Republic of Ireland experienced unprecedented economic growth from the mid-1990s until the 2008\u20132010 Irish financial crisis.{{cite}}Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, particularly in the fields of literature and, to a lesser degree, science and education. A strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed for example through native sports and the Irish language, alongside a common Western culture, such as contemporary music and drama, and sports such as football, rugby and golf, and the English language.{{TOC limit}}\u000aHistory{{History of Ireland}}\u000a{{Main}}\u000aPre-history and medieval period\u000aMost of Ireland was covered with ice until the end of the last ice age over 9,000 years ago. Sea-levels were lower and Ireland, as with its neighbour Great Britain, were a part of continental Europe rather than being islands. Mesolithic stone age inhabitants arrived some time after 8,000 BC and agriculture followed with the Neolithic Age around 4,500 to 4,000 BC when sheep, goats, cattle and cereals were imported from the Iberian peninsula. At the C\u00e9ide Fields, preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day County Mayo, is an extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world,{{cite web}} dating from not long after this period. Consisting of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls, the fields were farmed for several centuries between 3,500 and 3,000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops. The Bronze Age &ndash; defined by the use of metal &ndash; began around 2,500 BC with technology changing people''s everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel, harnessing oxen, weaving textiles, brewing alcohol, and skillful metalworking, producing new weapons and tools, and fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, France, Spain and Portugal where Celtic languages developed.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite book}}{{cite web}}{{cite book}}{{cite web}}The Iron Age in Ireland is traditionally associated with people known as the Celts. The Celts were commonly thought to have colonised Ireland in a series of invasions between the 8th and 1st centuries BC. The Gaels, the last wave of Celts, were said to have divided the island into five or more kingdoms after conquering it. However, academics now favor a theory that emphasises the diffusion of culture from overseas as opposed to a military colonisation.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}} Finds such as Clonycavan Man are given as evidence for this theory.The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers. Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as Mikra Brettania (Lesser Britain), in contrast to the larger island, which he called Megale Brettania (Great Britain).{{Cite book}} In his later work, Geography, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as Iwernia and to Great Britain as Albion. These "new" names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples were made.{{cite book}} The Romans would later refer to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, Hibernia,{{cite web}} or Scotia.{{cite book}} Ptolemy records sixteen tribes inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD.{{cite journal}} The relationship between the Roman Empire and the tribes of ancient Ireland is unclear. Objective references that exist are from Roman writings whereas native accounts are confined to Irish poetry and myth. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been found, for example at New Grange.Carson, R.A.G. and O''Kelly, Claire: A catalogue of the Roman coins from Newgrange, Co. Meath and notes on the coins and related finds, pages 35-55. Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, volume 77, section CIreland continued as a patchwork of rival tribes but, beginning in the 7th century AD, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, "Ireland, 400\u2013800", in D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn (ed.), A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182\u2013234. The High King was said to preside over the patchwork of provincial kingdoms that together formed Ireland. Each of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the High King. The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept only became a political reality in the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one.{{cite encyclopedia}}, p.253 However, Ireland did have a unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.{{Cite book}}The Chronicle of Ireland records that in 431 AD Bishop Palladius arrived in Ireland on a mission from Pope Celestine I to minister to the Irish "already believing in Christ."{{CathEncy}} The same chronicle records that Saint Patrick, Ireland''s best known patron saint, arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick but consensus that they both took place{{cite book}} and certainty that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion.{{cite book}} Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and Greek learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of Ireland, Latin and Greek learning was preserved in Ireland during the Early Middle Ages in contrast to elsewhere in Europe, where the Dark Ages followed the decline of the Roman Empire.{{cite book}} The arts of manuscript illumination, metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the Book of Kells, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses{{Cite book}} that still dot the island today.From the 9th century, waves of Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns.{{citation}} These raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep seated in Ireland.\u000aNorman and English invasions{{Main}}On May 1, 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights with an army of about six hundred landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford. It was led by Richard de Clare, called Strongbow due to his prowess as an archer.{{cite news}} The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, king of Leinster.In 1166, Mac Morrough had fled to Anjou, France following a war involving Tighearn\u00e1n Ua Ruairc, of Breifne, and sought the assistance of the Angevin king, Henry II, in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the Papal Bull  Laudabiliter, issued by Adrian IV in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level since the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been some controversy over the bull, but its authenticity is now generally accepted.{{cite encyclopedia}}, p.361 It granted Henry dominion over Ireland in the name of the papacy.{{cite book}} In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called Peter''s Pence, is still extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of  Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry''s successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the native Brehon Law so that by the late thirteenth century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting Dublin for London and Irish Church for Church of England, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.However, from the mid-fourteenth century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the native Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law."Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish". Nebraska Department of Education. However, by the end of the 15th century central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale and under the provisions of Poynings'' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.English rule of law was reinforced and expanded, in the sixteenth century leading to the Tudor reconquest of Ireland. A near complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the seventeenth century following the Nine Years'' War and the Flight of the Earls. This control was further consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the seventeenth century, which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war. A further 16,000 were tried and sent to slavery in the West Indies. Some historians estimate that as much as half of the pre-war population of Ireland may have died as a result of the conflict.{{cite web}}The religious struggles of the seventeenth century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of the Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging penal laws, recusant Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.{{cite web}} The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.\u000aUnion with Great BritainAbnormal weather conditions, teamed with the arrival of a deadly potato mould from North America, caused the failure of the ubiquitous potato crop. This resulted in the famine in 1740. An estimated 250,000{{cite book}} people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease. The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but little more.{{cite}} Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could not contain the ensuing mortality. In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings'' Law was repealed giving Ireland virtual legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since the Norman invasion. However, the British government still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland above the consent of the Irish parliament.In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments passed the Act of Union which, effective as of January 1, 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799.  According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.{{cite book}} Thus, Ireland became part of an extended United Kingdom, ruled directly by the parliament at Westminster in London. A Viceregal administration was established and under the government appointed the Chief Secretary at Dublin Castle.The Great Famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of one million Irish people and over a million more emigrated to escape it.{{cite web}} By the end of the decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid 20th century. Immediately prior to the famine, the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census.{{cite news}} The population has never returned to this level since.{{cite news}} The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland (County Leitrim) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.The 19th and early 20th century saw the rise of modern Irish nationalism, primarily among the Roman Catholic population. Pre-eminent among these was Daniel O''Connell. He was elected as member of parliament for Ennis in a surprise result despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O''Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign which was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Act through the Westminster parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the bill and proclaim it into law. George''s father had opposed the earlier Prime Minister''s, Pitt the Younger, plan to introduce such a bill following the Union in 1801 fearing Catholic Emancipation to be in conflict with the Act of Settlement 1701.A subsequent campaign led by O''Connell for the repeal of the Act of Union failed. Later in the century, Charles Stewart Parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "Home Rule". Unionists, especially those located in the northern part of the island, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.{{cite book}} After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the Ulster Volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of Lord Carson. Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the Irish Volunteers, whose aim was to ensure that the Home Rule Bill was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. However, before it could be implemented the Act was suspended for the duration of the Great War (World War I). The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under John Redmond, took the name National Volunteers and supported Irish involvement in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the name, the Irish Volunteers, and opposed Ireland''s involvement in the war.{{cite book}}The failed Easter Rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group and the British response, executing the leaders of the Rising one by one over seven weeks, changed the national mood towards Home Rule. The pro-independence party, Sinn F\u00e9in, received overwhelming endorsement in the General Election of 1918 and in 1919 declared its own parliament and government, the Irish Republic. British authorities attempted to extinguish this challenge, sparking a guerilla war from 1919 to July 1921, ending in a truce.{{cite journal}} In 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British Government and representatives of the First D\u00e1il (Assembly of Ireland). It gave all of Ireland complete independence in their home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy. However, an oath of allegiance to the British Crown had to be exercised. And Northern Ireland was to form a home rule state within the new Irish Free State but held an opt-out clause, which it exercised immediately as expected.{{cite book}} Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent civil war between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by \u00c9amon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.{{cite journal}}\u000aPartition\u000aIndependent Ireland\u000aDuring its first decade, the newly-formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.The state was neutral during World War II, but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies, particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite being neutral, approximately 50,000{{cite news}} volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded Victoria Crosses.Ireland also had links to German Intelligence. Both the Abwehr (the German military intelligence service) and the SD (the Sicherheitsdienst, the intelligence service of the SS) sent agents to Ireland.Hull,Mark:The Irish Interlude: German Intelligence in Ireland, 1939-1943, Journal of Military History, Vol. 66, No. 3 (Jul, 2002), pp. 695-717 This chain of Irish-German intelligence was broken in September 1941 when the southern Irish police made arrests on the basis of electronic surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Ireland, including the United States. To the southern Irish, counterintelligence was more than mere luxury but a fundamental line of defense. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and hopelessly devoid of modern weapons, a determined German attack with even just a few divisions would have meant certain occupation.Large-scale emigration marked the 1950s and 1980s but, beginning in 1987, the economy improved and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger.{{cite book}} The Republic''s real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999{{cite}} and in 2000 Ireland was the sixth richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita.{{cite}} Social changes followed quickly on the heels of economic prosperity ranging from the \u2018modernisation\u2019 of the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in Dublin to the decline in authority of the Catholic Church. The financial crisis of 2008-2010 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).{{cite}}\u000aNorthern Ireland{{Main}}Northern Ireland was created as a division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and until 1972 it was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War and Belfast suffered a bombing raid in 1941. Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south. One, James Joseph Magennis, receiving the Victoria Cross for valour.Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines, meaning that the Government of Northern Ireland (elected by "first past the post" from 1929) was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fueled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}} In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by loyalist counter-protests.{{cite book}} The government''s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased.{{cite book}} The Northern Ireland government was forced to request the British Army to aid the police, who were exhausted after several nights of serious rioting. In 1969, the paramilitary Provisional IRA, which favoured the creation of a united Ireland, emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the "British occupation of the six counties".Other groups, on both the unionist side and the nationalist side, participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.{{cite news}} Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed "direct rule" from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. There were several ultimately unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the Belfast Agreement was concluded and ratified by referendum across the entire island. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing between the two communities. Violence decreased greatly after the signing of the accord and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament.{{cite web}} The power-sharing assembly was suspended several times but was restored again in 2007. In that year, the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland and began withdrawing troops.\u000aGovernance{{Further}}{{Counties of Ireland imagemap}}Ireland is occupied by two political entities:\u000a\u000aThe Republic of Ireland, \u0009ratified 21 January 1919 and officially formed on the 6 December 1922, (officially Ireland), a sovereign state that covers five-sixths of the island. Its capital is Dublin.\u000aNorthern Ireland, established on the 3 May 1921, is a part of the United Kingdom that covers the remaining sixth. Its capital is Belfast.\u000a\u000aTraditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,{{cite book}} Ireland has thirty-two traditional counties. Twenty-six of the counties are in the Republic of Ireland and six counties are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example post and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes,{{cite web}} but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts as well as in addresses.{{cite web}}City status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter.

The two jurisdictions share a transport, telecommunications, energy and water systems. With a few notable exceptions, this island is the main organisational unit for major religious, cultural and sporting organisations. The island fields a single international team in most sports, for example, and March 17 is celebrated throughout Ireland as the traditional Irish holiday of St. Patrick''s Day. One notable exception to this is Association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name "Ireland" until the 1950s. An all-Ireland club competition for soccer, the Setanta Cup, was created in 2005.The 1998 Belfast Agreement provides for political co-operation between the two jurisdictions. The North-South Ministerial Council, established under the agreement, is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive can formulate all-island policies in twelve "areas of co-operation" such as agriculture, the environment and transport. Six of these policy areas have associated all-island "implementation bodies". For example, food safety is managed by the Food Safety Promotion Board and Tourism Ireland markets the island as a whole. Three major political parties, Sinn F\u00e9in, the Irish Green Party and, most recently, Fianna F\u00e1il, are organised on an all-island basis. However, only the former two of these has contested elections and hold legislative seats in both jurisdictions.Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the euro and pound sterling), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-island basis. This has in part been facilitated by the two jurisdictions'' shared membership of the European Union. Calls for the creation of an "all-island economy" have been made from members of the business community and policymakers so as to benefit from economies of scale and boost competitiveness.{{cite web}} One area in which the island already operates largely as a single market is electricity{{cite web}} and there are plans for the creation of an all-island gas market.{{cite web}} Support for such initiatives comes from the Irish government and nationalist parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly.{{cite web}}\u000aGeography{{Main}}\u000a{{See also}}\u000aA ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.{{cite web}} This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightening occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.{{cite web}} Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap}} {{nowrap}} at inland weather stations, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, 2003 and 2006. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2009-2010. Temperatures fell as low as -13\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) in some parts and up to a metre (3&nbsp;feet) of snow in mountainous areas.The island consists of varied geological provinces. In the far west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} In the southwest, around Bantry Bay and the mountains of Macgillicuddy''s Reeks, is an area of substantially deformed, but only lightly metamorphosed, Devonian-aged rocks.{{cite web}} This partial ring of "hard rock" geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country, giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape.

Aquatic wildlife, such as species of turtle, shark, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the Barn Swallow. Most of Ireland''s bird species come from Iceland, Greenland and Africa.Several different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,{{cite web}} particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no top predator in Ireland, populations of animals, such as semi-wild deer, that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.There are no snakes in Ireland and only one reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the great Irish elk, the Irish wolf and the great auk. Some previously extinct birds, such as the Golden Eagle, have recently been reintroduced after decades of extirpation.Until medieval times, Ireland was heavily forested with oak, pine and birch. Forests today cover only about 9% (4,450&nbsp;km\u00b2 or one million acres){{cite web}} of Ireland, which makes it the most deforested area in Europe. Much of the land is now covered with pasture, and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (Ulex europaeus), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been "invaded" by some grasses, such as Spartina anglica.{{cite web}}\u000aThe algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574 and can be divided as follows:\u000a\u000a264 Rhodophyta\u000a152 Heterokontophyta\u000a114 Chloropyta\u000a31 Cyanophyta\u000a\u000aRarer species include:{{cite_journal}}\u000a\u000aItonoa marginifera (J.Ag.) (Masuda &#38; Guiry)\u000aSchmitzia hiscockiana Maggs and Guiry\u000aGelidiella calcicola Maggs &#38; Guiry\u000aGelidium maggsiae Rico &#38; Guiry\u000aHalymenia latifolia P.Crouan &#38; H.Crouan ex K\u00fctzing.\u000a\u000aThe island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established. For example:{{cite journal}}\u000a\u000aAsparagopsis armara Harvey, which originated in Australia and was first recorded by M. De Valera in 1939\u000aColpomenia peregrina Sauvageau, which is now locally abundant and first recorded in the 1930s\u000aSargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt, now well established in a number of localities on the south, west, and north-east coasts\u000aCodium fragile ssp. fragile (formerly reported as ssp. tomentosum), now well established.\u000a\u000aCodium fragile ssp. atlanticum has recently been established to be native, although for many years it was regarded as an alien species.Because of its mild climate, many species, including sub-tropical species such as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island itself can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.\u000aThe impact of agriculture\u000aThe long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and "Runoff" from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and act as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides, but recent reforms to have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.{{cite web}}Forest covers about 10% of the country, with most designated for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.{{Cite book}} Seanad Debate involving Former Minister for Environment Heritage and Local Government\u000aEconomy{{Main}}Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution. One reason given why Ireland did not experience an industrial revolution is because of the scarcity of coal and iron,{{cite web}} resources that facilitate an industrial revolution. However, there were other countries that lacked these resources, but nonetheless industrialised, so there may be other reasons why Ireland did not industrialise.{{cite book}} Nineteenth century explanations for why Ireland did not industrialise did not blame the absence of natural resources but that, "The fault is not in the country, but in ourselves; the absence of successful enterprise is owing to the fact, that we do not know how to succeed \u2026 we want special industrial knowledge."{{cite}} Some historians today point to the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England. They point out that iron and coal prices in Ireland were as cheap as they were in parts of England outside of the mining centres &ndash; and a little cheaper in some parts &ndash; and that, on the eve of union with Great Britain, Ireland was industrialising (particularly the linen industry).{{cite book}} It may be that, by merging the two economies suddenly, Ireland did not industrialise, but "instead became a supplier of food &ndash; and capital &ndash; to the ''mainland''."{{cite}}Mass emigration followed in the wake of the Great Famine in the mid-1800s and continued until the 1980s.Irish Emigration, past and present. Lessons to be learned?. University College Cork. However, the Irish economic experience reversed dramatically during the course of the 1990s, which saw the beginning of unprecedented economic growth in the Republic of Ireland, in a phenomenon known as the "Celtic Tiger,"{{cite news}} and peace being restored in Northern Ireland. In 2005, the Republic of Ireland was ranked the best place to live in the world, according to a "quality of life" assessment by The Economist magazine.{{cite journal}} The Republic of Ireland joined the euro in 1999, while Northern Ireland remained with the pound sterling. Both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland entered recession in 2008{{cite web}}{{cite web}} and, in 2009, the unemployment rate for the Republic of Ireland was 12.5%{{cite web}} due to the 2008\u20132010 Irish financial crisis.\u000aTransport{{Main}}Ireland has five main international airports: Dublin Airport, Belfast International Airport (Aldergrove), Cork Airport, Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport (Knock). Dublin Airport is the busiest of these,{{cite web}} carrying over 22 million passengers per year{{cite web}} and a new terminal and runway are under construction.{{cite web}} All provide services to Britain and continental Europe, while Belfast International, Dublin and Shannon also offer transatlantic services. For several decades, Shannon was an important refuelling point for transatlantic routes.{{cite web}} In recent years it has opened a pre-screening service allowing passengers to pass through US immigration services before departing from Ireland. There are also several smaller regional airports: George Best Belfast City Airport, City of Derry Airport, Galway Airport, Kerry Airport (Farranfore), Sligo Airport (Strandhill), Waterford Airport and Donegal Airport (Carrickfinn). Scheduled services from these regional points are in the main limited to flights traveling to other parts of Ireland and to Britain. Airlines based in Ireland include Aer Lingus (the former national airline of the Republic of Ireland), Ryanair, Aer Arann and CityJet.Ireland has ports in major ports in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Rosslare, Derry and Waterford. Smaller ports exist in Arklow, Ballina, Drogheda, Dundalk, D\u00fan Laoghaire, Foynes, Galway, Larne, Limerick, New Ross, Sligo, Warrenpoint and Wicklow. Ports in the Republic handle 3.6 million travellers crossing the sea between Ireland and Britain each year.{{cite web}} The vast majority of heavy goods trade is done by sea. Ports in Northern Ireland handle 10 megatons (11 million short tons) of goods trade with Britain annually, while ports in the Republic of Ireland handle 7.6 Mt (8.4 million short tons).Ferry connections between Great Britain and Ireland via the Irish Sea include routes from Swansea to Cork, Fishguard and Pembroke to Rosslare, Holyhead to D\u00fan Laoghaire, Stranraer to Belfast and Cairnryan to Larne. There is also a connection between Liverpool and Belfast via the Isle of Man. The world''s largest car ferry, the MV Ulysses, is operated by Irish Ferries on the Dublin&ndash;Holyhead route. In addition, Rosslare and Cork run ferries to France.Several (mainly hypothetical) plans to build an "Irish Sea tunnel" have been proposed. The first serious proposal was made in 1897, which was for a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland crossing the North Channel. Most recently, in 2004, the Institution of Engineers of Ireland proposed the "Tusker Tunnel" between the ports of Rosslare and Fishguard.{{Cite book}}{{cite news}} In 1997 a British engineering firm, Symonds, proposed a rail tunnel from Dublin to Holyhead. Either of the two most recent proposals, at {{convert}}, would be by far the longest tunnel in the world and would cost an estimated \u20ac20bn.The railway network in Ireland was developed by various private companies during the 19th century, with some receiving government funding in the late 19th century. The network reached its greatest extent by 1920. A broad gauge of 1,600mm (5&nbsp;ft 3in){{cite web}} was agreed as the standard the island, although there were also hundreds of kilometres of 914mm (3&nbsp;ft) narrow gauge railways.Long distance passenger trains in the Republic of Ireland are managed by Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann and connect most major towns and cities. In Northern Ireland, all rail services are provided by Northern Ireland Railways.  Additionally, Ireland has one of the largest dedicated freight railways in Europe, operated by Bord na M\u00f3na totalling nearly {{convert}}.{{cite web}}In Dublin, two local rail networks provide transport in the city and its immediate vicinity. The Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) links the city centre with coastal suburbs. A new light rail system, the Luas, opened in 2004 and transports passengers to the central and western suburbs. Several more Luas lines are planned as well as an Dublin Metro. The DART is run by Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann and the Luas is run by Veolia under franchise from the Railway Procurement Agency. Under the Irish government''s Transport 21 plan, the Cork to Midleton rail link was reopened in 2009. The re-opening of the Navan-Clonsilla rail link and the Western Rail Corridor are amongst future projects as part of the same plan.{{cite web}}Services in Northern Ireland are sparse in comparison to the rest of Ireland or Britain. A large railway network was severely curtailed in the 1950s and 1960s.{{cite web}} Current services includes suburban routes to Larne, Newry and Bangor, as well as services to Derry. There is also a branch from Coleraine to Portrush.{{cite web}}Motorists in Ireland drive on the left. There is an extensive road network and a developing motorway network fanning out from Dublin and Belfast in particular. Historically, land owners developed most roads and later Turnpike Trusts collected tolls so that as early as 1800 Ireland had a {{convert}} road network.{{cite web}} In recent years, the Irish Government launched a new transport plan that is the largest investment project ever in Ireland''s transport system: investing \u20ac34 billion from 2006 until 2015. Work on a number of road projects has already commenced and a number of objectives have been completed.{{cite web}}Ireland''s first mail coach services were contracted with the government by John Anderson with William Bourne in 1791 who also paid to improve the condition of the roads.{{Cite book}} The system of mail coaches, carriages and "bians" was further developed by Charles Bianconi, based in Clonmel, from 1815 as a fore-runner of the modern Irish public transportation system.{{cite web}} Today, the main bus companies are Bus \u00c9ireann in the Republic and Ulsterbus in Northern Ireland, both of which offer extensive passenger service in all parts of the island. Dublin Bus specifically serves the greater Dublin area and Metro operates services within the greater Belfast area.Signposts and speed limits in the Republic of Ireland are shown in kilometres per hour, with speed limits having changed in 2005. Distance and speed limit signs in Northern Ireland use imperial units in common with the rest of United Kingdom.\u000aPower networks\u000aFor much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks{{cite web}} and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland''s peak demand.{{cite web}}\u000aSimilar to electricity, the natural gas distribution network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim.{{cite web}} Most of Ireland''s gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing supply is coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast{{cite web}}{{cite web}} and the Corrib Gas Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.There have been recent efforts in Ireland to use renewable energy such as wind power. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. What will be the world''s largest offshore wind farm is currently being developed at the Arklow Bank Wind Park off the coast of County Wicklow. It is predicted that the Arklow wind farm will generate 10% of Ireland''s power needs when it is complete. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB''s Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.{{cite web}}\u000aDemographics{{Main}}\u000aPeople have lived in Ireland for at least 9,000 years, although little is known about the palaeolithic and neolithic inhabitants of the island. Genetic research in 2004 suggests they came to the island by traveling over generations along the Atlantic coast from Spain. Earlier theories were that they migrated from central Europe. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of dozens of different peoples that may or may not be mythological, for example the Cruithne, Attacotti, Conmaicne, E\u00f3ganachta, \u00c9rainn, and Soghain, to name but a few. Over the past 1000 years or so, Vikings, Normans, Scots and English have all added to the indigenous population.Ireland''s largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is the Roman Catholicism representing over 73% for the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 53% of Northern Ireland).{{cite news}} The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic''s population describe themselves as of no religion.{{cite web}} About 14% of the Northern Ireland population described themselves as so.The population of Ireland rose rapidly since the 16th century until the mid-19th century. A devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\u000aEmigration from Ireland over this period contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia where today a large Irish diaspora live. The pattern of immigration over this period particularly devastated the western and southern sea-boards. Prior to the Great Famine, the provinces of Connacht, Munster and Leinster were more or less evenly populated whereas Ulster was far less densely populated than the other three. Today, Ulster and Leinster, and in particular Dublin, have a far greater population density than Munster and Connacht.With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland has become a place of immigration instead. Since joining the European Union expanded to included Poland in 2004, Polish people have made up the largest number immigrants (over 150,000){{cite news}} from Central Europe, followed by other immigrants from Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia.{{cite web}} The Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large-scale immigration. The 2006 census recorded that 420,000 foreign nationals, or about 10% of the population, lived in the Republic of Ireland.{{cite web}} Chinese and Nigerians, along with people from other African countries, have accounted for a large proportion of the non-European Union migrants to Ireland. Up to 50,000 eastern European migrant workers may have left Ireland towards the end of since 2008.{{cite news}}English has been spoken in Ireland since the Middle Ages and, since a language shifts during the nineteenth century, has replaced Irish as the first language vast majority of the population.{{cite book}} Less than 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system{{cite web}} and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as "Irish speakers". In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language but official recognition is afforded to both Irish and Ulster Scots, which is also spoken by a number south of the border. In recent decades, with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.\u000aCulture{{Main}}Ireland''s culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient immigration and influences (such as Gaelic culture) and more recent Anglicisation and Americanisation as well as participation in a broader European culture. In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe, which also includes Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Mann and Brittany. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork. These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still is popular today in jewellery and graphic art,{{cite web}} as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern "Celtic" culture in general.Religion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century plantations, has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland''s pre-Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the 5th century. The Hiberno-Scottish missions, begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba, spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, earning Ireland the sobriquet, "the island of saints and scholars". In more recent years, the Irish pubs have become outposts of Irish culture worldwide.The national theatre is the Abbey Theatre founded in 1904 and the national Irish-language theatre is An Taibhdhearc, established in 1928 in Galway.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} Playwrights such as Se\u00e1n O''Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned.{{cite book}}\u000aArt{{Main}}There are a number of languages used in Ireland. Irish is the main language to have originated from within the island. Since the later nineteenth century, English has become the predominant first language having been a spoken language in Ireland since the Middle Ages. A large minority claim some ability to speak Irish today, although it is the first language only of a small percentage of the population. Under the constitution of the Republic of Ireland, both languages have official status with Irish being the national and first official language. In Northern Ireland, English is the dominant state language, whilst Irish and Ulster Scots are recognised minority languages.Irelands has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, particularly in the English language. Poetry in Irish is the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century. In English, Jonathan Swift, still often called the foremost satirist in the English language, was wildly popular in his day for works such as Gulliver''s Travels and A Modest Proposal and Oscar Wilde is known most for his often quoted witticisms. In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature: George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Although not a Nobel Prize winner, James Joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce''s 1922 novel Ulysses is considered one of the most important works of Modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as "Bloomsday".{{cite web}} Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage{{cite book}} through writers such as John McGahern and poets such as Seamus Heaney.The Irish traditional music and dance is seen a recent surge in popularity, not least through the phenomenon of Riverdance, a theatrical performance of Irish traditional dancing.{{cite book}} In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music fell out of favour, especially in urban areas.{{cite book}} During the 1960s, inspired by the American folk music movement, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as The Dubliners, The Chieftains, Emmet Spiceland, The Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney''s Men and individuals like Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada and Christy Moore.{{cite book}} Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison, and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, The Saw Doctors, The Corrs, Sin\u00e9ad O''Connor, Clannad, The Cranberries, Black 47 and The Pogues among others. During the 1990s, a sub-genre of folk metal emerged in Ireland that fused heavy metal music with Irish and Celtic music. The pioneers of this sub-genre were Cruachan, Primordial, and Waylander. Some contemporary music groups stick closer to a "traditional" sound, including Altan, T\u00e9ada, Dan\u00fa, Dervish, L\u00fanasa, and Solas. Others incorporate multiple cultures in a fusion of styles, such as Afro Celt Sound System and K\u00edla. The theme is can also be seen among Ireland''s entries to the Eurovision Song Contest, where Ireland is also the most successful country in the competition with seven wins.{{cite news}}The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange{{cite book}} and is traced through Bronze age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong indigenous tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy.\u000aScienceThe Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his early Middle Ages. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Anglo-Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole. Robert Boyle was an 17th century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist. He is largely regarded one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle''s law.{{cite web}} 19th century physicist, John Tyndall, discovered the Tyndall effect, which explains why the sky is blue. Father Nicholas Joseph Callan, Professor of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College, is best known for his invention of the induction coil, transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century.Other notable Irish physicists include Ernest Walton, winner of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation.{{cite web}} William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the Kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.{{cite news}}George Johnstone Stoney introduced the term electron in 1891. John Stewart Bell was the originator of Bell''s Theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize. Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton, famous for the invention of quaternions. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth was influential in the development of neo-classical economics, including the Edgeworth box. John B. Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000-digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003. John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students.Ireland has eight universities and numerous Institutes of Technologies as well as the The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, which was established in 1940 with physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger as director.{{cite web}}\u000aSports{{Main}}\u000a\u000aSee also: List of Irish sports people\u000a\u000aGaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, and represents 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8%.{{cite web}} and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in Ireland''s sporting calendar.{{cite web}} Swimming, golf, aerobics, soccer, cycling, Gaelic football and billiards/snooker are the sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation.{{cite web}} Soccer is the most popular sport involving national teams.Many other sports are also played and followed, including basketball, boxing, cricket, fishing, golf, greyhound racing, handball, hockey, horse racing, motor sport, rugby league, show jumping and tennis.\u000aField sports\u000a\u000aHurling and Gaelic football, handball and rounders make up the national sports of Ireland, collectively known as Gaelic games.  Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of ladies'' Gaelic football and camogie (women''s variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500{{cite web}} capacity Croke Park in north Dublin. Major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium, international rugby and soccer are being played there.{{cite news}} All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.The Irish Football Association (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with Cliftonville F.C. in Belfast being Ireland''s oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based, Protestant clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast{{cite web}}Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations'' associations, the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against Italy). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as Ireland.\u000aIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI''s team be known only as "Republic of Ireland" and that the IFA''s team be known as "Northern Ireland" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in 1958 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1982 and 1986. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in 1990 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1994, 2002 and the European Championships in 1988. There is significant Irish interest in the English and, to a lesser extent, Scottish soccer leagues.Unlike soccer, Ireland continues to field a single national rugby team and a single association, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every Rugby World Cup, making the quarter-finals in four of them. Ireland also hosted games during the 1991 and the 1999 Rugby World Cups (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the Magners League and three compete for the Heineken Cup. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, Ulster (1999{{cite web}}), Munster (2006{{cite web}} and 2008{{cite web}}) and Leinster (2009{{cite web}}) have won the Heineken Cup. In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the Six Nations Championship against the other European elite sides. This success, including Triple Crowns in 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a Grand Slam, in 2009.{{cite web}}The Ireland cricket team was among the associate nations that qualified for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. It defeated Pakistan and finished second in its pool, earning a place in the Super 8 stage of the competition. The team also competed in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 after jointly winning the qualifiers, where they also made the Super 8 stage. Ireland also won the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier to secure their place in the 2011 Cricket World Cup, as well as official ODI status through 2013.The Irish rugby league team is made up predominantly of players based in England with Irish-family connections, with others drawn from the local competition and Australia. Ireland reached the quarter-finals of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup.\u000aOther sports\u000aGreyhound racing and horse racing are both popular in Ireland. Greyhound stadiums are well-attended and there are frequent horse race meetings. The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs.{{citation}} The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.{{cite web}}Irish athletics has seen some development in recent times, with Sonia O''Sullivan winning two notable medals at 5,000 metres; gold at the 1995 World Championships and silver at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Gillian O''Sullivan won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 World Championships, while sprint hurdler Derval O''Rourke won gold at the 2006 World Indoor Championship in Moscow. Olive Loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk in the World Athletics Championships in Berlin in 2009.Boxing is governed by the Irish Amateur Boxing Association. In 1992, Michael Carruth won a gold medal for boxing in the Barcelona Olympic Games and in 2008 Kenny Egan won a silver medal for boxing in the Olympic Games in Beijing.{{Cite news}}Golf is very popular and golf tourism is a major industry attracting more than 240,000 golfing visitors annually.{{cite web}} The 2006 Ryder Cup was held at The K Club in County Kildare.{{cite web}} P\u00e1draig Harrington became the first Irishman since Fred Daly in 1947 to win the British Open at Carnoustie in July 2007.{{cite web}} He successfully defended his title in July 2008{{cite news}} before going on to win the PGA Championship in August.{{cite web}} Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years and was the first winner from Ireland.The west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. In recent years, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.{{cite web}}With thousands of lakes, over {{convert}} of fish bearing rivers and over {{convert}} of coastline, Ireland is a popular angling destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery. Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,{{cite web}} and the range of sea angling species is around 80.{{cite web}}\u000aFood and drink\u000aIrish food and cuisine takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island''s temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of  cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.{{cite book}} Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow. For this reason, pork and white meat were more common than beef and a thick fatty strips of salted bacon (or rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the Irish diet since the Middle Ages. The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the Maasai) was common{{cite}} and black pudding, made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the "breakfast roll".The introduction of the potato in the second half of the sixteenth century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food and by the mid-19th century the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk.{{Cite journal}} A typical family, consisting a man, a woman and four children, would eat {{convert}} of potatoes a week. Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental unsophistication to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage.Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a "New Irish Cuisine" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences{{cite book}} has emerged.{{cite}} This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, oysters, mussels and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in Europe. An example of this new cuisine is "Dublin Lawyer": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.{{cite book}} Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford.Ireland once dominated the world''s market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world''s whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands){{cite book}} and tariffs on Irish whiskey across British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s,{{cite}} sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century.{{cite news}} In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.{{cite book}} Irish whiskey, however, remained popular domestically and in recent decades has grown in popularity again internationally.{{cite news}} Typically, Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky, but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies. Whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the "Irish coffee" (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.Stout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although originally being more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Bulmers (marketed outside of the Republic of Ireland as Magners), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.{{cite}}\u000aSee also{{Portal}}\u000a\u000aIrish states since 1171\u000aList of divided islands\u000aList of Ireland-related topics\u000aList of islands of Ireland\u000a\u000a\u000aNotes{{Reflist}}\u000aReferences{{Reflist}}\u000aBibliography{{Refbegin}}\u000a\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite Journal}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{Cite journal}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{Cite journal}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{Cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{Cite journal}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{cite book}}\u000a{{Refend}}\u000aExternal links{{Wikiquote}}\u000a{{Commons category}}\u000a\u000a{{Wikitravel}}\u000a{{Wikitravel}}\u000aGovernment of Ireland\u000aNorthern Ireland Executive\u000a\u000a{{Template group}}\u000a{{Good article}}\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a{{Link FA}}\u000aaf:Ierland\u000aam:\u12a0\u12e8\u122d\u120b\u1295\u12f5\u000aang:\u012arland\u000aar:\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u064a\u0631\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0627\u000aarc:\u0710\u071d\u072a\u0720\u0722\u0715 (\u0713\u0719\u072a\u072c\u0710)\u000aast:Islla d''Irlanda\u000azh-min-nan:\u00c9ire-t\u00f3\u000abe:\u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u045e \u0406\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b\u044f\u000abe-x-old:\u0406\u0440\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0434\u044b\u044f (\u0432\u044b\u0441\u043f\u0430)\u000abcl:Irlandya\u000abs:Irska (ostrvo)\u000abr:Iwerzhon\u000abg:\u0418\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f (\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432)\u000aca:Irlanda\u000acs:Irsko (ostrov)\u000acy:Iwerddon\u000ada:Irland (\u00f8)\u000ade:Irland (Insel)\u000adz:\u0f68\u0f60\u0f72\u0f62\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f63\u0f7a\u0f53\u0f4c\u0f0b\u000aet:Iirimaa saar\u000ael:\u0399\u03c1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u000aes:Irlanda (isla)\u000aeo:Irlando (insulo)\u000aeu:Irlanda\u000afa:\u062c\u0632\u06cc\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0644\u0646\u062f\u000afo:\u00cdrland (oyggj)\u000afr:Irlande (\u00eele)\u000aga:\u00c9ire\u000agv:Nerin\u000agd:\u00c8irinn\u000agl:Illa da Irlanda\u000agu:\u0a86\u0aaf\u0ab0\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0a82\u0aa1\u0aa8\u0ac1\u0a82 \u0a97\u0aa3\u0aa4\u0a82\u0aa4\u0acd\u0ab0\u000ahak:Oi-ng\u00ec-l\u00e0n\u000ako:\uc544\uc77c\ub79c\ub4dc \uc12c\u000ahr:Irska (otok)\u000aid:Pulau Irlandia\u000aia:Irlanda\u000ais:\u00cdrland\u000ait:Irlanda (isola)\u000ahe:\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05dc\u05e0\u05d3 (\u05d0\u05d9)\u000akn:\u0c90\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb2\u0cc6\u0c82\u0ca1\u0ccd\u000aka:\u10d8\u10e0\u10da\u10d0\u10dc\u10d3\u10d8\u10d0 (\u10d9\u10e3\u10dc\u10eb\u10e3\u10da\u10d8)\u000akw:Wordhon\u000akg:Irlande\u000aku:\u00cerland (girav)\u000ala:Hibernia\u000alv:\u012arija (sala)\u000alt:Airijos sala\u000ahu:\u00cdr-sziget\u000amr:\u0906\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0932\u0902\u0921\u000aarz:\u0627\u064a\u0631\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627 (\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0647)\u000anl:Ierland (eiland)\u000aja:\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u5cf6\u000ano:Irland (\u00f8y)\u000ann:Irland\u000anrm:Irlande\u000aoc:Irlanda (illa)\u000apnb:\u0622\u0626\u0631\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0688\u000apms:Irlanda (\u00ecsola)\u000atpi:Aialan\u000apl:Irlandia (wyspa)\u000apt:Irlanda\u000aro:Irlanda (insul\u0103)\u000army:Irland (dvip)\u000arm:Irlanda\u000aqu:Ilanda wat''a\u000aru:\u0418\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f (\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432)\u000asm:''Aealani\u000asa:\u0906\u092f\u0930\u094d\u0932\u0948\u0902\u0921\u000asco:Ireland\u000asimple:Ireland\u000ask:\u00cdrsko (ostrov)\u000asl:Irska (otok)\u000aszl:Irlandyjo (wyspa)\u000asr:\u0418\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u000afi:Irlanti (saari)\u000atl:Irlanda (pulo)\u000ata:\u0b85\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u000ath:\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e44\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e41\u0e25\u0e19\u0e14\u0e4c\u000atr:\u0130rlanda (ada)\u000auk:\u0406\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0456\u044f (\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0432)\u000aug:\u0626\u0649\u0631\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0649\u064a\u06d5\u000avi:\u0110\u1ea3o Ireland\u000avls:Ierland\u000awuu:\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u000ayi:\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05dc\u05d0\u05e0\u05d3 (\u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d6\u05dc)\u000azh:\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u5c9b','Ireland','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland')
INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(63,0,'{{Sociology}}\u000a{{Refimprove}}\u000aQualitative research is a method of inquiry appropriated in many different academic disciplines, traditionally in the social sciences, but also in market research and further contexts.Denzin, Norman K. & Lincoln, Yvonna S. (Eds.). (2005). The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research (3rd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-2757-3 Qualitative researchers aim to gather an in-depth understanding of human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior. The qualitative method investigates the why and how of decision making, not just what, where, when. Hence, smaller but focused samples are more often needed, rather than large samples.Qualitative methods produce information only on the particular cases studied, and any more general conclusions are only hypotheses (informative guesses). Quantitative methods can be used to verify which of such hypotheses are true.\u000aHistory\u000aUntil the 1970s, the phrase ''qualitative research'' was used only to refer to a discipline of anthropology or sociology. During the 1970s and 1980s qualitative research began to be used in other disciplines, and became a significant type of research in the fields of education studies, social work studies, women''s studies, disability studies, information studies, management studies, nursing service studies, political science, psychology, communication studies, and many other fields. Qualitative research occurred in the consumer products industry during this period, with researchers investigating new consumer products and product positioning/advertising opportunities.  The earliest consumer research pioneers including Gene Reilly of The Gene Reilly Group in Darien, CT, Jerry Schoenfeld of Gerald Schoenfeld & Partners in Tarrytown, NY and Martin Calle of Calle & Company, Greenwich, CT, also Peter Cooper in London, England, and Hugh Mackay in Mission, Australia.{{Citation needed}} There continued to be disagreement about the proper place of qualitative versus quantitative research. In the late 1980s and 1990s after a spate of criticisms from the quantitative side, new methods of qualitative research evolved, to address the perceived problems with reliability and imprecise modes of data analysis.Taylor, 1998 During this same decade, there was a slowdown in traditional media advertising spending, so there was heightened interest in making research related to advertising more effective. In the last thirty years the acceptance of qualitative research by journal publishers and editors has been growing. Prior to that time many mainstream journals were prone to publish research articles based upon the natural sciences and which featured quantitative analysis Loseke, Donileen R. & Cahil, Spencer E. (2007). \u201cPublishing qualitative manuscripts: Lessons learned\u201d. In C. Seale, G. Gobo, J. F. Gubrium, & D. Silverman (Eds.), Qualitative Research Practice: Concise Paperback Edition, pp. 491-506. London: Sage. ISBN 978-1-7619-4776-9.\u000aDistinctions from quantitative research{{Unreferenced section}}\u000a(In simplified terms - Qualitative means a non-numerical data collection or explanation based on the attributes of the graph or source of data. For example, if you are asked to explain in qualitative terms a thermal image displayed in multiple colours, then you would explain the colour differences rather than the heat''s numerical value.)First, cases can be selected purposefully, according to whether or not they typify certain characteristics or contextual locations. Secondly, the role or position of the researcher is given greater critical attention. This is because in qualitative research the possibility of the researcher taking a ''neutral'' or transcendental position is seen as more problematic in practical and/or philosophical terms.  Hence qualitative researchers are often exhorted to reflect on their role in the research process and make this clear in the analysis. Thirdly, while qualitative data analysis can take a wide variety of forms it tends to differ from quantitative research in the focus on language, signs and meaning as well as approaches to analysis that are holistic and contextual, rather than reductionist and isolationist. Nevertheless, systematic and transparent approaches to analysis are almost always regarded as essential for rigor. For example, many qualitative methods require researchers to carefully code data and discern and document themes in a consistent and reliable way.Perhaps the most traditional division in the way qualitative and quantitative research have been used in the social sciences is for qualitative methods to be used for exploratory (i.e., hypothesis-generating) purposes or explaining puzzling quantitative results, while quantitative methods are used to test hypotheses. This is because establishing content validity - do measures measure what a researcher thinks they measure? - is seen as one of the strengths of qualitative research. While quantitative methods are seen as providing more representative, reliable and precise measures through focused hypotheses, measurement tools and applied mathematics.  By contrast, qualitative data is usually difficult to graph or display in mathematical terms.Qualitative research is often used for policy and program evaluation research since it can answer certain important questions more efficiently and effectively than quantitative approaches. This is particularly the case for understanding how and why certain outcomes were achieved (not just what was achieved) but also answering important questions about relevance, unintended effects and impact of programs such as: Were expectations reasonable?  Did processes operate as expected?  Were key players able to carry out their duties? Were there any unintended effects of the program? Qualitative approaches have the advantage of allowing for more diversity in responses as well as the capacity to adapt to new developments or issues during the research process itself. While qualitative research can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct, many fields of research employ qualitative techniques that have been specifically developed to provide more succinct, cost-efficient and timely results.  Rapid Rural Appraisal is one formalised example of these adaptations but there are many others.\u000aData CollectionQualitative researchers may use different approaches in collecting data, such as the grounded theory practice, narratology, storytelling, classical ethnography, or shadowing. Qualitative methods are also loosely present in other methodological approaches, such as action research or actor-network theory.  Forms of the data collected can include interviews and group discussions, observation and reflection field notes, various texts, pictures, and other materials.Qualitative research often categorizes data into patterns as the primary basis for organizing and reporting results. {{Citation needed}} Qualitative researchers typically rely on the following methods for gathering information: Participant Observation, Non-participant Observation, Field Notes, Reflexive Journals, Structured Interview, Semi-structured Interview, Unstructured Interview, and Analysis of documents and materials Marshall, Catherine & Rossman, Gretchen B. (1998). Designing Qualitative Research. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-1340-8.The ways of participating and observing can vary widely from setting to setting. Participant observation is a strategy of reflexive learning, not a single method of observingLindlof, T. R., & Taylor, B. C. (2002) Qualitative communication research methods: Second edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc. ISBN 0-7619-2493-0.  In participant observation http://www.techsociety.com/cal/soc190/fssba2009/ParticipantObservation.pdf researchers typically become members of a culture, group, or setting, and adopt roles to conform to that setting.  In doing so, the aim is for the researcher to gain a closer insight into the culture''s practices, motivations and emotions. It is argued that the researchers'' ability to understand the experiences of the culture may be inhibited if they observe without participating.  Some distinctive qualitative methods are the use of focus groups and key informant interviews.  The focus group technique involves a moderator facilitating a small group discussion between selected individuals on a particular topic. This is a particularly popular method in market research and testing new initiatives with users/workers. One traditional and specialized form of qualitative research is called cognitive testing or pilot testing which is used in the development of quantitative survey items.  Survey items are piloted on study participants to test the reliability and validity of the items.In the academic social sciences the most frequently used qualitative research approaches include the following:  \u000a\u000aEthnographic Research, used for investigating cultures by collecting and describing data that is intended to help in the development of a theory.  This method is also called \u201cethnomethodology\u201d or &#34;methodology of the people&#34;.  An example of applied ethnographic research, is the study of a particular culture and their understanding of the role of a particular disease in their cultural framework.\u000aCritical Social Research, used by a researcher to understand how people communicate and develop symbolic meanings.\u000aEthical Inquiry, an intellectual analysis of ethical problems.  It includes the study of ethics as related to obligation, rights, duty, right and wrong, choice etc.\u000aFoundational Research, examines the foundations for a science, analyses the beliefs and develops ways to specify how a knowledge base should change in light of new information. \u000aHistorical Research, allows one to discuss past and present events in the context of the present condition, and allows one to reflect and provide possible answers to current issues and problems. Historical research helps us in answering questions such as: Where have we come from, where are we, who are we now and where are we going? \u000aGrounded Theory, is an inductive type of research, based or \u201cgrounded\u201d in the observations or data from which it was developed; it uses a variety of data sources, including quantitative data, review of records, interviews, observation and surveys. \u000aPhenomenology, describes the \u201csubjective reality\u201d of an event, as perceived by the study population; it is the study of a phenomenon. \u000aPhilosophical Research, is conducted by field experts within the boundaries of a specific field of study or profession, the best qualified individual in any field of study to use an intellectual analyses, in order to clarify definitions, identify ethics, or make a value judgment concerning an issue in their field of study.\u000a\u000a\u000aData analysis{{Unreferenced section}}\u000a\u000aInterpretive techniques\u000aThe most common analysis of qualitative data is observer impression. That is, expert or bystander observers examine the data, interpret it via forming an impression and report their impression in a structured and sometimes quantitative form.\u000a\u000aCoding\u000aCoding is an interpretive technique that both organizes the data and provides a means to introduce the interpretations of it into certain quantitative methods. Most coding requires the analyst to read the data and demarcate segments within it.  Each segment is labeled with a \u201ccode\u201d \u2013 usually a word or short phrase that suggests how the associated data segments inform the research objectives.  When coding is complete, the analyst prepares reports via a mix of: summarizing the prevalence of codes, discussing similarities and differences in related codes across distinct original sources/contexts, or comparing the relationship between one or more codes.Some qualitative data that is highly structured (e.g., open-end responses from surveys or tightly defined interview questions) is typically coded without additional segmenting of the content. In these cases, codes are often applied as a layer on top of the data. Quantitative analysis of these codes is typically the capstone analytical step for this type of qualitative data.Contemporary qualitative data analyses are sometimes supported by computer programs. These programs do not supplant the interpretive nature of coding but rather are aimed at enhancing the analyst\u2019s efficiency at data storage/retrieval and at applying the codes to the data. Many programs offer efficiencies in editing and revising coding, which allow for work sharing, peer review, and recursive examination of data.A frequent criticism of coding method is that it seeks to transform qualitative data into quantitative data, thereby draining the data of its variety, richness, and individual character. Analysts respond to this criticism by thoroughly expositing their definitions of codes and linking those codes soundly to the underlying data, therein bringing back some of the richness that might be absent from a mere list of codes.\u000a\u000aRecursive abstraction\u000aSome qualitative datasets are analyzed without coding. A common method here is recursive abstraction, where datasets are summarized, those summaries are then further summarized, and so on.  The end result is a more compact summary that would have been difficult to accurately discern without the preceding steps of distillation.A frequent criticism of recursive abstraction is that the final conclusions are several times removed from the underlying data. While it is true that poor initial summaries will certainly yield an inaccurate final report, qualitative analysts can respond to this criticism.  They do so, like those using coding method, by documenting the reasoning behind each summary step, citing examples from the data where statements were included and where statements were excluded from the intermediate summary.\u000a\u000aMechanical techniques\u000aSome techniques rely on leveraging computers to scan and sort large sets of qualitative data.  At their most basic level, mechanical techniques rely on counting words, phrases, or coincidences of tokens within the data.  Often referred to as content analysis, the output from these techniques is amenable to many advanced statistical analyses.  Mechanical techniques are particularly well-suited for a few scenarios.  One such scenario is for datasets that are simply too large for a human to effectively analyze, or where analysis of them would be cost prohibitive relative to the value of information they contain.  Another scenario is when the chief value of a dataset is the extent to which it contains \u201cred flags\u201d (e.g., searching for reports of certain adverse events within a lengthy journal dataset from patients in a clinical trial) or \u201cgreen flags\u201d (e.g., searching for mentions of your brand in positive reviews of marketplace products).A frequent criticism of mechanical techniques is the absence of a human interpreter.  And while masters of these methods are able to write sophisticated software to mimic some human decisions, the bulk of the \u201canalysis\u201d is nonhuman.  Analysts respond by proving the value of their methods relative to either a) hiring and training a human team to analyze the data or b) letting the data go untouched, leaving any actionable nuggets undiscovered.\u000aParadigmatic differencesContemporary qualitative research has been conducted from a large number of various paradigms that influence conceptual and metatheoretical concerns of legitimacy, control, data analysis, ontology, and epistemology, among others.  Research conducted in the last 10 years has been characterized by a distinct turn toward more interpretive, postmodern, and critical practicesGuba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-2757-3.

Lincoln (Eds.), The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research (3rd ed.), pp. 191-215. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-2757-3.  Each of the paradigms listed by Guba and Lincoln are characterized by axiomatic differences in axiology, intended action of research, control of research process/outcomes, relationship to foundations of truth and knowledge, validity (see below), textual representation and voice of the researcher/participants, and commensurability with other paradigms.  In particular, commensurability involves the extent to which paradigmatic concerns \u201ccan be retrofitted to each other in ways that make the simultaneous practice of both possible\u201dGuba, E. G., & Lincoln, Y. S. (2005). \u201cParadigmatic controversies, contradictions, and emerging influences" (p. 200). In N. K. Denzin & Y. S. Lincoln (Eds.), The Sage Handbook of Qualitative Research (3rd ed.), pp. 191-215. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ISBN 0-7619-2757-3. Positivist and postpositivist paradigms share commensurable assumptions but are largely incommensurable with critical, constructivist, and participatory paradigms.  Likewise, critical, constructivist, and participatory paradigms are commensurable on certain issues (e.g., intended action and textual representation).\u000aValidationA central issue in qualitative research is validity (also known as credibility and/or dependability).  There are many different ways of establishing validity, including: member check, interviewer corroboration, peer debriefing, prolonged engagement, negative case analysis, auditability, confirmability, bracketing, and balance. Most of these methods were coined, or at least extensively described by Lincoln and Guba (1985)Lincoln Y and Guba EG (1985) Naturalist Inquiry, Sage Publications, Newbury Park, CA.\u000aAcademic researchBy the end of the 1970s many leading journals began to publish qualitative research articles  and several new journals emerged which published only qualitative research studies and articles about qualitative research methods Denzin, Norman K. & Lincoln, Yvonna S.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(64,0,'\u000aPunctuated equilibrium is a theory in evolutionary biology which proposes that some sexually reproducing species will experience little evolutionary change for most of their geological history, remaining in an extended state called stasis. When evolution occurs, it is localized in rare, rapid events of branching speciation, called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which species split into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another. Thus, "punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time."Gould, Stephen Jay, & Eldredge, Niles (1977). "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered." Paleobiology 3 (2): 115-151. (p.145)Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against the theory of phyletic gradualism, which states that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (anagenesis). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.In 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould published a landmark paper developing this theory and called it punctuated equilibria.Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972). "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism" In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., Models in Paleobiology. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82-115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge Time frames. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985. Available here http://www.nileseldredge.com/NELE.htm. Their paper  built upon Ernst Mayr''s theory of geographic speciation,Mayr, Ernst (1954). "Change of genetic environment and evolution" In J. Huxley, A. C. Hardy and E. B. Ford. Evolution as a Process. London: Allen and Unwin, pp. 157-180. I. Michael Lerner''s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis,Lerner, Israel Michael (1954). Genetic Homeostasis. New York: John Wiley. as well as their own empirical research.Eldredge, Niles (1971). "The allopatric model and phylogeny in Paleozoic invertebrates." Evolution 25 (1): 156-167.Gould, S. J. (1969). "An evolutionary microcosm: Pleistocene and Recent history of the land snail P. (Poecilozonites) in Bermuda." Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. 138: 407-532. Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.\u000aPunctuated equilibrium''s historyPunctuated equilibrium originated as an extension of Ernst Mayr''s concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation. Although much of the basic workings of the theory were proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954, historians of science generally recognize the 1972 paper by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould as the foundational document of a new paleobiological research program.Mayr, Ernst (1992). "Speciational Evolution or Punctuated Equilibria." In Albert Somit and Steven Peterson The Dynamics of Evolution. New York: Cornell University Press, pp. 21-48.Shermer, Michael (2001). The Borderlands of Science. New York: Oxford University Press.Geary, Dana (2008). "The Legacy of Punctuated equilibrium." In Warren D. Allmon et al. Stephen Jay Gould: Reflections on His View of Life. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 127-145. Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr''s hypothesis mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was generally concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity (or "punctuational patterns") found in the fossil record. Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould''s paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and that punctuated equilibrium "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."Prior to the Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge published a 1971 paper in the journal Evolution suggesting that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr''s preferred mechanism might suggest a possible resolution.The Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1971. The symposium focused its attention on the possibility that modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year''s meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that "Eldredge''s 1971 publication [on Paleozoic trilobites] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject\u2014so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly."{{cite book}}\u000aAccording to Gould "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould."Gould, S. J. (1991). "Opus 200" Natural History 100 (August): 12-18.\u000aTheoretical mechanismsWhen Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, allopatric speciation was considered the "standard" theory of speciation. This theory was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper "Change of genetic environment and evolution," and his classic volume Animal Species and Evolution (1963).Mayr, Ernst (1963). Animal Species and Evolution. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.Allopatric speciation suggests that species which are composed of large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the genetic process of gene flow. New and even beneficial mutations are diluted by the population''s size and are unable to reach fixation due to factors such as constantly changing environments. If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the homogenizing effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from natural selection is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution should be rare. This stimulating hypothesis was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper.Ernst Mayr often emphasized the use of population thinking to describe species, rather than models which evoked a typological approach. In order to contrast the differences in population structures he coined the terms ecotypic and typostrophic variation. Ecotypic variation describes the genetics of large central populations which are stabilized by the homogenizing effects of gene flow. Small peripherally isolated populations, in contrast, possess typostrophic variation which "have the characteristic features of incipient species, but what is more important they often are species or incipient species of an entirely new type. That is, they may have morphological or ecological features that deviate quite strikingly and unexpectedly from the ''parental'' pattern."As time went on Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation. He also moved away from tying stasis to internal constraints. Gould was particularly attracted to Douglas Futuyma''s work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms.Futuyma, Douglas (1987) "On the role of species in anagenesis" American Naturalist 130: 465\u2013473.The theory of punctuated equilibrium also contributed to the theory that species are Darwinian individuals, and not just classes, thereby providing a stronger framework for a hierarchical theory of evolution. Other biologists have applied punctuated equilibrium to non-sexual species, even the evolution of viruses.Nichol, S.T, Joan Rowe, and Wlater M. Fitch (1993). "Punctuated equilibrium and positive Darwinian evolution in vesicular stomatitis virus." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 90 (Nov.): 10424-28.\u000aCommon misconceptionsSterelny (2007) claimed that Eldredge and Gould''s "hypothesis has been misunderstood in two important ways. In some early discussions of the idea, the contrast between geological and ecological time was blurred. Hence, Gould and Eldredge were interpreted as making a very radical claim: species originate more or less overnight, in a single step. (But) Gould and Eldredge agree that the new structures are almost always assembled over a number of generations, rather than all at once by macromutation...So by ''rapidly'', they mean rapidly by geologist''s standards". So with a coarse and incomplete fossil record, "a speciation that took 50,000 years would seem instantaneous", relative to the several million years of a species'' existence.{{cite book}} Also ISBN 978-1840467-80-2 Sterelny notes that "in recent work, they have clarified a second misunderstanding. In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner''s The Beak of the Finch describes this very process".Sterelny, K. (2007) p.96Punctuated equilibrium is often confused with George Gaylord Simpson''s quantum evolution,Francisco, Ayala (2005). "On Stephen Jay Gould''s Monumental Masterpiece" Theology and Science 3 (1): 103 Richard Goldschmidt''s saltationism,Mayr, Ernst (1982). The Growth of Biological Thought Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. 617; and Michael Ruse Sociobiology, Sense or Nonsense? New York: Springer, p. 216; For reply see S. J. Gould Structure. 2002, pp. 765, 778, 1001, 1005, 1009. pre-Lyellian catastrophism, and the phenomenon of mass extinction. Punctuated equilibrium is therefore mistakenly thought to oppose the concept of gradualism, when it is actually a form of gradualism, in the ecological sense of biological continuity. This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sediments, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change from one generation to the next. To this end, Gould later commented that "Most of our paleontological colleagues missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about allopatric speciation or had not considered its translation to geological time. Our evolutionary colleagues also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales".The relationship between punctuationism and gradualism can be better appreciated by considering an example. Suppose the average length of a limb in a particular species grows 50 centimeters (20 inches) over 70,000 years\u2014a large amount in a geologically short period of time. If the average generation is seven years, then our given time span corresponds to 10,000 generations. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that if the limb size in our hypothetical population evolved in the most conservative manner, it need only increase at a rate of 0.005&nbsp;cm per generation (= 50&nbsp;cm/10,000), despite its abrupt appearance in the geological record.{{Citation needed}}Richard Dawkins dedicated a chapter in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion with rate of change, surrounding the theory of punctuated equilibrium. His first, and main point, is to argue that phyletic gradualism in the sense of uniformity of rates\u2014what he refers to as "constant speedism"\u2014is a "caricature of Darwinism"Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker. New York: W. W. Norton & Co., p. 227. and "does not really exist."Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 228. His one exception to this rule is the non-adaptive evolution observed in molecular evolution. His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once this caricature is dismissed, we are left with only one logical alternative, which Dawkins calls "variable speedism." Variable speedism may be distinguished in one of two ways: "discrete variable speedism" and "continuously variable speedism." Eldredge and Gould, believing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as "discrete variable speedists," and "in this respect they are genuinely radical."Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 245. They believe that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. "Continuously variable speedists," on the other hand believe that "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis."Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 245-246. Emphasis added. Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his claim that: "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it.",The Extended Phenotype, 1982, p. 102.  and it is this particular claim that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.Another pervasive misunderstanding of punctuated equilibrium was that it invoked large-scale mutations, the sort invoked by Richard Goldschmidt in The Material Basis of Evolution.Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, pp. 230-236. According to Dawkins, punctuated equilibrium "has no connection with macromutation and true saltation,Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p 236. but rather "followed from long accepted conventional Darwinism," namely Mayrian allopatric speciation.Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, pp. 236, 239, 243.\u000aCriticismRichard Dawkins believes that the apparent gaps represented in the fossil record document migratory events rather than evolutionary events. According to Dawkins, evolution certainly  occurred but  "probably gradually" elsewhere.Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 240. However, the punctuational equilibrium model may still be inferred from both the observance of stasis and documented examples of rapid and episodic speciation events documented in the fossil record.Cheetham, Alan, Jeremy Jackson, and Lee-Ann Hayek (1994). "Quantitative genetics of bryozoan phenotypic evolution." Evolution 48: 360-375.Dawkins also emphasizes that punctuated equilibrium has been "oversold by some journalists",Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 250-251. but partly due to Eldredge and Gould''s "later writings".Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 241. Dawkins contends that the theory "does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity".Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 250. It is a "minor gloss," an "interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory," and "lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis".Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 251.Criticism of punctuated equilibrium has even appeared from non-scientists. Philosopher Daniel Dennett is especially critical of Gould''s presentation of punctuated equilibrium in his book Darwin''s Dangerous Idea. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims about the theory, and that each time Gould made a revolutionary statement\u2014or appeared to do so\u2014he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position.Dennett, Daniel (1995). Darwin''s Dangerous Idea. New York: Simon & Schuster, pp. 282-299. Gould responded to Dennett''s claims in The New York Review of Books,Gould, S. J. (1997). "Darwinian Fundamentalism" The New York Review of Books, June 12, pp. 34-37; And "Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism" The New York Review of Books, June 26, pp. 47-52. and in his technical volume The Structure of Evolutionary Theory.Gould, S. J. (2002). The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, pp. 1006-1021. Online hereHeidi Scott, an literary scholar,Scott, Heidi (2007). "Stephen Jay Gould and the Rhetoric of Evolutionary Theory," Rhetoric Review 26 (2): 120-141. argued that Gould''s use of analogy and metaphor constitutes a non-scientific discourse serving to validate a scientific theory. Scott claims that Gould\u2014particularly in his popular essays\u2014uses a variety of strategies from literature, political science, and personal anecdotes to substantiate the general pattern of punctuated equilibrium (long periods of stasis interrupted by rapid, catastrophic change). Gould responded that critics often made the mistake of confusing the context of discovery with the context of justification. While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his massive interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould''s rhetorical skills.Randy Allen Harris, Professor of Rhetoric at the University of Waterloo, in a more positive evaluation, states that "re-analysis of existing fossil data has shown, to the increasing satisfaction of the paleontological community, that Eldredge and Gould were correct in identifying periods of evolutionary stasis which are interrupted by much shorter periods of evolutionary change."Harris, R. A. (2007). Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science. Mahwah NJ: Hermagoras Press, p. 73.\u000aRelation to Darwin''s theoriesThe sudden appearance of most species in the geologic record and the lack of evidence of substantial gradual change in most species\u2014from their initial appearance until their extinction\u2014has long been noted, including by Charles Darwin who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation.Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species. London: John Murray, p. 301.Darwin, Charles (1871). The Origin of Species. London: John Murray, p. 119-120. When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influence of catastrophism put forward by Georges Cuvier which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of evolution in accordance with the gradualism promoted by his friend Charles Lyell. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 Essay "Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false."Eldredge, Niles (2006) "Confessions of a Darwinist." The Virginia Quarterly Review 82 (Spring): 32-53.It is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of On the Origin of Species states that "Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus". Lingula is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old.Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species. London: John Murray. p. 313. In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species Darwin wrote that "the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form."Darwin, Charles (1869). The Origin of Species. London: John Murray. 5th edition, p. 551. Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin''s conception of evolution.According to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, "peripheral isolates" are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, "I can by no means agree ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements....  Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely."Darwin, Charles (1869). The Origin of Species. London: John Murray. 5th edition, pp. 120-121.The importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin''s early thinking, as shown in his Essay of 1844. But by the time he wrote the Origin he had downplayed its importance. He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:\u000aThroughout a great and open area, not only will there be a greater chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms&nbsp;... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.Darwin, Charles (1869). The Origin of Species.

Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that have been found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).\u000aPunctuated equilibrium in social theory{{See also}}\u000aPunctuated equilibrium in social theory is a method of understanding change in complex social systems, particularly how policy change and the development of conflicts seem to progress in extended periods of stasis, punctuated by sudden shifts in radical change.\u000aPunctuated equilibrium in language changeRecent work using computational phylogenetic methods show that punctuational bursts play an important factor when languages split from one another, accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.Atkinson, Quentin, et al.

Cambridge University Press, 2008. 3.The people of Sudan have a long history extending from antiquity, which is intertwined with the history of Egypt, with which it was united politically over several periods. After gaining independence from Egypt and the United Kingdom in 1956, Sudan suffered a civil war, lasting 17 years, subsequently followed by ethnic, religious and economic conflicts between the Northern Sudanese (with Arab and Nubian roots), and the Christian and animist Nilotes of Southern Sudan.Seteney Shami, Linda Herrera, Between field and text, "Ethical Dilemmas of Research Among Sudanese in Egypt: Producing Knowledge about the Public and the Private" by Anita Hausermann Fabos, (American Univ in Cairo Press: 1999), p.100United Nations Environment Programme, Sudan, (UNEP/Earthprint: 2007), p.35 This led to a second civil war in 1983, and due to continuing political and military struggles, Sudan was seized in a bloodless coup d''\u00e9tat by colonel Omar al-Bashir in 1989, who thereafter proclaimed himself President of Sudan.{{cite web}}Sudan then achieved great economic growth by implementing macroeconomic reforms and finally ended the civil war by adopting a new constitution in 2005 with rebel groups in the south, granting them limited autonomy to be followed by a referendum about independence in 2011.{{cite news}} Rich in natural resources such as petroleum and crude oil, Sudan''s economy is currently amongst the fastest growing in the world.War in Sudan?

A settled culture appeared around 8,000 B.C. They subsisted on hunting, fishing and grain foraging and kept cattle and sheep.{{cite web}}The area was known to the Egyptians as the Kush and had strong cultural and religious ties to Egypt. In the 8th century BC, however, Kush came under the rule of an aggressive line of monarchs, ruling from the capital city, Napata, who gradually extended their influence into Egypt. About 750&nbsp;BC, a Kushite king called Kashta conquered Upper Egypt and became ruler of Thebes until approximately 740&nbsp;BC. His successor, Piankhy, subdued the delta, reunited Egypt under the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, and founded a line of kings who ruled Kush and Thebes for about a hundred years. The dynasty''s intervention in the area of modern Syria caused a confrontation between Egypt and Assyria. When the Assyrians in retaliation invaded Egypt, Taharqa (688\u2013663&nbsp;BC), the last Kushite pharaoh, withdrew and returned the dynasty to Napata, where it continued to rule Kush and extended its dominions to the south and east.The Land of Kush predates ancient Egypt, Khamat, Khemet. Please take special note here that the Ammonites, were situated at Jabal Barkal, Sudan. And when early Khamat, Egypt rose ''Israil disappeared (fell).  The Ammonites (see Amun, Amon, Ammun, Ammon, Moon), along with the Tribe of Dan came to prominence. That''s how Khamat, Khemet, Aegyptian nation was born. The given chronology of the Dynasties of Egypt is wrong. Egypt proper came to and end about 4000 years. Subsequently, the Kingdom of Yudah (the Arabian Peninsula) was born.In 590&nbsp;BC, an Egyptian army sacked Napata, compelling the Kushite court to move to Meroe near the Sixth Cataract. The Meroitic kingdom subsequently developed independently of Egypt, and during the height of its power in the 2nd and 3rd centuries&nbsp;BC, Meroe extended over a region from the Third Cataract in the north to Sawba, near present-day Khartoum (the modern capital of Sudan).The pharaonic tradition persisted among Meroe''s rulers, who raised stelae to record the achievements of their reigns and erected pyramids to contain their tombs. These objects and the ruins at palaces, temples and baths at Meroe attest to a centralised political system that employed artisans'' skills and commanded the labour of a large workforce. A well-managed irrigation system allowed the area to support a higher population density than was possible during later periods. By the 1st century BC, the use of hieroglyphs gave way to a Meroitic script that adapted the Egyptian writing system to an indigenous, Nubian-related language spoken later by the region''s people.In the 6th century&nbsp;AD, the people known as the Nobatae occupied the Nile''s west bank in northern Kush. Eventually they intermarried and established themselves among the Meroitic people as a military aristocracy. Until nearly the 5th century, Rome subsidised the Nobatae and used Meroe as a buffer between Egypt and the Blemmyes. About AD&nbsp;350, an Axumite army from Abyssinia captured and destroyed Meroe city, ending the kingdom''s independent existence.\u000aChristianity and Islam (543-1821)By the 6th century, fifty states had emerged as the political and cultural heirs of the Meroitic Kingdom. Nobatia in the north, also known as Ballanah, had its capital at Faras, in what is now Egypt; the central kingdom, Muqurra (Makuria), was centred at Dunqulah, about 13 kilometres south of modern Dunqulah; and Alawa (Alodia), in the heartland of old Meroe, which had its capital at Sawba (now a suburb of modern-day Khartoum). In all three kingdoms, warrior aristocracies ruled Meroitic populations from royal courts where functionaries bore Greek titles in emulation of the Byzantine court. A missionary sent by Byzantine empress Theodora arrived in Nobatia and started preaching Christianity about AD 540. The Nubian kings became Monophysite Christians. However, Makuria was of the Melkite Christian faith, unlike Nobatia and Alodia.After many attempts at military conquest failed, the Arab commander in Egypt concluded the first in a series of regularly renewed treaties known as Albaqut (pactum) with the Nubians that governed relations between the two peoples for more than 678 years. Islam progressed in the area over a long period of time through intermarriage and contacts with Arab merchants and settlers, particularly the Sufi nobles of Arabia. In 1093, a Muslim prince of Nubian royal blood ascended the throne of Dunqulah as king. The two most important Arab tribes to emerge in Nubia were the Jaali and the Juhayna. Both showed physical continuity with the indigenous pre-Islamic population. Today''s northern Sudanese culture combines Nubian and Arabic elements.During the 16th century, a people called the Funj, under a leader named Amara Dunqus, appeared in southern Nubia and supplanted the remnants of the old Christian kingdom of Alwa, establishing As-Saltana az-Zarqa (the Blue Sultanate), also called the Sultanate of Sennar. The Blue Sultanate eventually became the keystone of the Funj Empire. By the mid-16th century, Sinnar controlled Al Jazirah and commanded the allegiance of vassal states and tribal districts north to the Third Cataract and south to the rainforests. The government was substantially weakened by a series of succession arguments and coups within the royal family. In 1820 Muhammad Ali of Egypt sent 4,000 troops to invade Sudan. The pasha''s forces accepted Sinnar''s surrender from the last Funj sultan, Badi VII.\u000aModern Egyptian union (1821-1885){{Main}}\u000aIn 1820, the Albanian-Ottoman ruler of Egypt Muhammad Ali Pasha invaded and conquered northern Sudan. Though technically the W\u0101li of Egypt under the Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad Ali styled himself as Khedive of a virtually independent Egypt. Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with Ismail the Magnificent mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt. This policy was expanded and intensified by Ibrahim''s son, Ismail I, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered. The Egyptian authorities made significant improvements to the Sudanese infrastructure (mainly in the north), especially with regard to irrigation and cotton production.\u000aIn 1879, the Great Powers forced the removal of Ismail and established his son Tewfik I in his place. Tewfik''s corruption and mismanagement resulted in the Orabi Revolt, which threatened the Khedive''s survival. Tewfik appealed for help to the British, who subsequently occupied Egypt in 1882. Sudan was left in the hands of the Khedivial government, and the mismanagement and corruption of its officials became notorious.W.S.Churchill, The River War (1899) chapter 1. See also Slatin Pasha, Fire and Sword in the Sudan, 1898. During the 1870s, European initiatives against the slave trade caused an economic crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of Mahdist forces.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}Eventually, a revolt broke out in Sudan, led by Muhammad Ahmad ibn Abd Allah, the Mahdi (Guided One), who sought to end foreign presence in Sudan. His revolt culminated in the winter of Khartoum and the death of the British governor General Gordon (Gordon of Khartoum) in 1885. The Egyptian and British subsequently withdrew forces from Sudan leaving the Mahdi to form a short-lived theocracy.\u000aThe Mahdist rule (1885-1899){{Main}}\u000aThe Mahdiyah (Mahdist regime) did not impose Islamic laws. The new ruler''s aim was more political than anything else. This was evident in the animosity he showed towards existing Muslims and locals who did not show loyalty to his system and rule. He authorised the burning of lists of pedigrees and books of law and theology as well as destruction of mosques in the north and east of Sudan. The Mahdi maintained that his movement was not a religious order that could be accepted or rejected at will, but that it was a universal regime, which challenged man to join or to be destroyed.Originally, the Mahdiyah was a jihad state, run like a military camp. Courts enforced the regime''s grip on power and the Mahdi''s precepts, which had the force of law. Six months after the fall of Khartoum, the Mahdi died of typhus, and after a power struggle amongst his deputies, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, with the help primarily of the Baqqara Arabs of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of Khalifa (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed Ansar (who were usually Baqqara) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\u000aRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa''s brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country. In 1887, a 60,000-man Ansar army invaded Ethiopia, penetrating as far as Gondar. In March 1889, king Yohannes IV of Ethiopia, marched on Metemma; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa''s general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar''s invincibility. The Belgians prevented the Mahdi''s men from conquering Equatoria, and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at Akordat (in Eritrea) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\u000aAnglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899-1956){{Main}}\u000aIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as British imperial territory. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the Nile headwaters. Britain feared that the other imperial powers would take advantage of Sudan''s instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at Aswan.Lord Kitchener led military campaigns from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener''s campaigns culminated in the Battle of Omdurman. Following defeat of the Mahdists at Omdurman, an agreement was reached in 1899 establishing Anglo-Egyptian rule, under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent. In reality, much to the revulsion of Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists, Sudan was effectively administered as a British colony. The British were keen to reverse the process, started under Muhammad Ali Pasha, of uniting the Nile Valley under Egyptian leadership, and sought to frustrate all efforts aimed at further uniting the two countries. During World War II, Sudan was directly involved militarily in the East African Campaign. Formed in 1925, the Sudan Defence Force (SDF) played an active part in responding to the early incursions (occupation by Italian troops of Kassala and other border areas) into the Sudan from Italian East Africa during 1940. In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces. From 1924 until independence in 1956, the British had a policy of running Sudan as two essentially separate territories, the north (Muslim) and south (Christian). The last British Governor-General was Sir Robert Howe.\u000aIndependence and civil wars (1956-1989){{Main}}\u000aThe continued British occupation of Sudan fueled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash in Egypt, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan. With the formal end of Ottoman rule in 1914, Hussein Kamel was declared Sultan of Egypt and Sudan, as was his brother Fuad I who succeeded him. The insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state persisted when the Sultanate was retitled the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan, but the British continued to frustrate these efforts. The Egyptian Revolution of 1952 finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt''s new leaders, Muhammad Naguib, whose mother was Sudanese, and later Gamal Abdel-Nasser, believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its sovereignty over Sudan. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdi successor Sayyid Abdel Rahman whom they believed could resist the Egyptian presence in Sudan. However they realised his political inability and diminishing support in northern and central Sudan, both Britain and Egypt with no option but to allow the Sudanese in the north and south together self determination and a free vote on independence. In 1954 the governments of Egypt and Britain signed a treaty guaranteeing Sudanese independence on 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People''s Palace where the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and white stripes, was raised in their place. Afterwards, Ismail Al-Azhari was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.Sudan Embassy - History2{{dead link}}In 1955, the year before independence, a civil war began between Northern and Southern Sudan. The southerners, anticipating independence, feared the new nation would be dominated by the north. Historically, the north of Sudan had closer ties with Egypt and was predominantly Arab and Muslim while the south was predominantly a mixture of Christianity and Animism. These divisions had been further emphasized by the British policy of ruling the north and south under separate administrations. From 1924, it was illegal for people living north of the 10th parallel to go further south and for people south of the 8th parallel to go further north. The law was ostensibly enacted to prevent the spread of malaria and other tropical diseases that had ravaged British troops, as well as to facilitate spreading Christianity among the predominantly Animist population while stopping the Arabic and Islamic influence from advancing south. The result was increased isolation between the already distinct north and south and arguably laid the seeds of conflict in the years to come.The resulting conflict lasted from 1955 to 1972. The 1955 war began when Southern army officers mutinied and then formed the Anya-Nya guerilla movement. A few years later the first Sudanese military regime took power under Major-General Abboud. Military regimes continued into 1969 when General Gaafar Nimeiry led a successful coup.Mitchell, Christopher R. Conflict Resolution and Civil War: Reflections on the Sudanese Settlement of 1972 Center for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University, August 1989 In 1972, a cessation of the north-south conflict was agreed upon under the terms of the Addis Ababa Agreement, following talks which were sponsored by the World Council of Churches. This led to a ten-year hiatus in the national conflict.In 1983, the civil war was reignited following President Gaafar Nimeiry''s decision to circumvent the Addis Ababa Agreement. President Gaafar Nimeiry attempted to create a federated Sudan including states in southern Sudan, which violated the Addis Ababa Agreement that had granted the south considerable autonomy. He appointed a committee to undertake \u201ca substantial review of the Addis Ababa Agreement, especially in the areas of security arrangements, border trade, language, culture and religion\u201d.Alier, Abel.

Under al-Bashir''s leadership, the new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.{{cite news}} He then became Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (a newly established body with legislative and executive powers for what was described as a transitional period), and assumed the posts of chief of state, prime minister, chief of the armed forces, and minister of defense.{{cite news}} Subsequent to al-Bashir''s promotion to the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, he allied himself with Hassan al-Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front (NIF), who along with al-Bashir began institutionalizing Sharia law in the northern part of Sudan. Further on, al-Bashir issued purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.Kepel, Jihad (2002), p.181The Sudanese Army advanced successfully in the south, reaching the southern borders with neighbouring Kenya and Uganda. The campaign started in 1989 and ended in 1994. During the fight the situation worsened in the tribal south causing casualties among the Christian and animist minority.Dange, Ted. \u201cSudan: Humanitarian Crisis, Peace Talks, Terrorism, and U.S. Policy\u201d Issue Brief for Congress. (August 2002): 7 Rebel leader Riek Mashar subsequently signed a peace agreement with the Sudanese government and became Vice President of Sudan. His troops took part in the fight against the SPLA during the government offensive in the 1990s. After the Sudanese army took control of the entire south with the help of Riek Mashar, the situation improved. In time, however, the SPLA sought support in the West by using the northern Sudanese government''s religious propaganda to portray the war as a campaign by the Arab Islamic government to impose Islam and the Arabic language on the Christian south.The war went on for more than 20 years, including the use of Russian-made combat helicopters and military cargo planes which were used as bombers to devastating effect on villages and tribal rebels alike. "Sudan''s independent history has been dominated by chronic, exceptionally cruel warfare that has starkly divided the country on racial, religious, and regional grounds; displaced an estimated four million people (of a total estimated population of thirty-two million); and killed an estimated two million people."Morrison, J.

The peace was consolidated with the official signing by both sides of the Nairobi Comprehensive Peace Agreement 9 January 2005, granting Southern Sudan autonomy for six years, to be followed by a referendum about independence. It created a co-vice president position and allowed the north and south to split oil deposits equally, but also left both the north''s and south''s armies in place. John Garang, the south''s peace agreement appointed co-vice president died in a helicopter crash on 1 August 2005, three weeks after being sworn in. This resulted in riots, but the peace was eventually able to continue. The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) was established under the UN Security Council Resolution 1590 of 24 March 2005. Its mandate is to support implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and to perform functions relating to humanitarian assistance, and protection and promotion of human rights. In October 2007 the former southern rebel Sudan People''s Liberation Movement (SPLM) withdrew from government in protest over slow implementation of a landmark 2005 peace deal which ended the civil war. Due to significant cultural, social, political, ethnic and economic changes in short amounts of time, conflicts were evolved in western and eastern provinces of Sudan in addition to an escalating conflict in Southern Sudan. Since the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), several violent struggles between the Janjaweed militia and rebel groups such as the Sudan People''s Liberation Army (SPLA), Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in the form of guerilla warfare in the Darfur, Red Sea and Equatoria regions have occurred, which has resulted in death tolls between 200,000{{cite news}} and 400,000,{{cite web}}{{cite news}} over 2.5 million people being displaced{{cite news}} and the diplomatic relations between Sudan and Chad being at a crisis level.{{cite news}}\u000aDarfur conflict\u000a{{Main}}\u000aJust as the long north-south civil war was reaching a resolution, some clashes occurred in the western region of Darfur in the early 1970s between the pastoral tribes. The rebels accused the central government of neglecting the Darfur region economically, although there is uncertainty regarding the objectives of the rebels and whether they merely seek an improved position for Darfur within Sudan or outright secession. Both the government and the rebels have been accused of atrocities in this war, although most of the blame has fallen on Arab militias known as the Janjaweed, which are armed men appointed by the Al Saddiq Al Mahdi administration to stop the longstanding chaotic disputes between Darfur tribes. According to declarations by the United States Government, these militias have been engaging in genocide; the fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them seeking refuge in neighbouring Chad. The government claimed victory over the rebels after capturing a town on the border with Chad in early 1994. However, the fighting resumed in 2003.On 9 September 2004, the United States Secretary of State Colin Powell termed the Darfur conflict a genocide, claiming it as the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.{{cite news}} There have been reports that the Janjawid has been launching raids, bombings, and attacks on villages, killing civilians based on ethnicity, raping women, stealing land, goods, and herds of livestock. So far, over 2.5 million civilians have been displaced and the death toll is variously estimated from 200,000 to 400,000 killed. These figures have remained stagnant since initial UN reports of the conflict hinted at genocide in 2003/2004.  Genocide has been considered a criminal offense under international humanitarial law since the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.Brief Primer on Genocide, the Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict ResearchOn 5 May 2006, the Sudanese government and Darfur''s largest rebel group, the SLM (Sudanese Liberation Movement), signed the Darfur Peace Agreement, which aimed at ending the three-year-long conflict.Darfur Peace Agreement{{dead link}} The agreement specified the disarmament of the Janjaweed and the disbandment of the rebel forces, and aimed at establishing a temporal government in which the rebels could take part.{{cite news}} The agreement, which was brokered by the African Union, however, was not signed by all of the rebel groups.

U.S. Department of State, May 2006\u000aSince the agreement was signed, however, there have been reports of widespread violence throughout the region. A new rebel group has emerged called the National Redemption Front, which is made up of the four main rebel groups that refused to sign the May peace agreement.{{cite news}} Recently, both the Sudanese government and government-sponsored Muslim militias have launched large offensives against the rebel groups, resulting in more deaths and more displacements. Clashes among the rebel groups have also contributed to the violence. Recent fighting along the Chad border has left hundreds of soldiers and rebel forces dead and nearly a quarter of a million refugees cut off from aid.{{cite web}} In addition, villages have been bombed and more civilians have been killed. UNICEF recently reported that around 80 infants die each day in Darfur as a result of malnutrition. The hunger in the Darfur region is still concerning many developed countries in the world.The people in Darfur are predominantly Black Africans of Muslim belief. While the Janjawid militia is made up of Arabized Black African (Black Arabs); the majority of Arab groups in Darfur remain uninvolved in the conflict.

D\u00e9by accuses Sudanese President Omar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir of trying to "destabilize our country, to drive our people into misery, to create disorder and export the war from Darfur to Chad."The problem prompting the declaration of war was an attack on the Chadian town of Adr\u00e9 near the Sudanese border that led to the deaths of either one hundred rebels (as most news sources reported) or three hundred rebels. The Sudanese government was blamed for the attack, which was the second in the region in three days,{{cite news}} but Sudanese foreign ministry spokesman Jamal Mohammed Ibrahim denied any Sudanese involvement, "We are not for any escalation with Chad.

While the Sudan People''s Liberation Army (SPLA) was the primary member of the Eastern Front, the SPLA was obliged to leave by the January 2005 agreement that ended the Second Sudanese Civil War. Their place was taken in February 2004 after the merger of the larger Beja Congress with the smaller Rashaida Free Lions, two tribal based groups of the Beja and Rashaida people, respectively."UNMIS Media Monitoring Report, 04 January 2006 (By Public Information Office)," United Nations Mission in Sudan The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a rebel group from Darfur in the west, then joined.Both the Free Lions and the Beja Congress stated that government inequity in the distribution of oil profits was the cause of their rebellion. They demanded to have a greater say in the composition of the national government, which has been seen as a destabilizing influence on the agreement ending the conflict in Southern Sudan.The Eastern Front had threatened to block the flow of crude oil, which travels from the oil fields of the south-central regions to outside markets through Port Sudan. A government plan to build a second oil refinery near Port Sudan was also threatened. The government was reported to have three times as many soldiers in the east to suppress the rebellion and protect vital infrastructure as in the more widely reported Darfur region.The Eritrean government in mid-2006 dramatically changed their position on the conflict. From being the main supporter of the Eastern Front they decided that bringing the Sudanese government around the negotiating table for a possible agreement with the rebels would be in their best interests.They were successful in their attempts and on the 19 June 2006, the two sides signed an agreement on declaration of principles.{{cite web}} This was the start of four months of Eritrean-mediated negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement between the Sudanese government and the Eastern Front, which culminated in signing of a peace agreement on 14 October 2006, in Asmara. The agreement covers security issues, power sharing at a federal and regional level, and wealth sharing in regards to the three Eastern states Kassala, Red Sea and Al Qadarif.In July 2007, many areas of the country were devastated by flooding, prompting an immediate humanitarian response by the United Nations and partners, under the leadership of acting United Nations Resident Coordinators David Gressly and Oluseyi Bajulaiye.{{cite web}} Over 400,000 people were directly affected, with over 3.5 million at risk of epidemics.{{cite web}} The United Nations have allocated US$ 13.5 million for the response from its pooled funds, but will launch an appeal to the international community to cover the gap.{{cite web}} The humanitarian crisis is in danger of worsening.

On 14 October 2006, both the Sudanese government and the Eastern Front signed a power-sharing agreement ending the insurgency.\u000a\u000a\u000aGovernment and politics{{Main}}\u000aOfficially, the politics of Sudan takes place, in the framework of a federal presidential representative democratic republic, where the President of Sudan is Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces in a multi-party system. Legislative power is vested in both the government and in the two chambers, the National Assembly (lower) and the Council of States (upper), of the bicameral National Legislature. The judiciary is independent and obtained by the Constitutional Court.However, following a deadly civil war and the now low scale war in Darfur, Sudan is widely recognized as an authoritarian state where all effective political power is obtained by President Omar al-Bashir and the ruling National Congress Party (NCP). The political system of the Republic of Sudan was restructured following a military coup on 30 June 1989, when Omar al-Bashir, then a colonel in the Sudanese Army, led a group of officers and ousted the government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi. Under al-Bashir''s leadership, the new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.He then became Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (a newly established body with legislative and executive powers for what was described as a transitional period), and assumed the posts of chief of state, prime minister, chief of the armed forces, and minister of defense. Further on, after institutionalizing Sharia law in the northern part of the country along with Hassan al-Turabi, al-Bashir issued purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.In 1993, Sudan was transformed into an Islamic authoritarian single-party state as al-Bashir abolished the Revolutionary Command Council and created the National Islamic Front (NIF) with a new parliament and government obtained solely by members of the NIF. At the same time, the structure of regional administration was replaced by the creation of twenty-six states, each headed by a governor, thus making Sudan a federal republic. As a result, the civil war with the Sudan People''s Liberation Army (SPLA) would only escalate in the following years.{{cite web}}Wasil Ali, "Sudanese Islamist opposition leader denies link with Darfur rebels", Sudan Tribune, 13 May 2008.Following the signing of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the government of Omar al-Bashir and the SPLA, a Government of National Unity was installed in Sudan in accordance with the Interim Constitution whereby a co-Vice President position representing the south was created in addition to the northern Sudanese Vice President. This allowed the north and south to split oil deposits equally, but also left both the north''s and south''s armies in place. Following the Darfur Peace Agreement, the office of senior Presidential advisor was allocated to Minni Minnawi, a Zaghawa of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA), and this thus became the fourth highest constitutional post.Executive posts are divided between the National Congress Party (NCP), the Sudan People''s Liberation Army, Eastern Front and factions of the Umma Party and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). This peace agreement with the rebel group Sudan People''s Liberation Army (SPLA) granted Southern Sudan autonomy for six years, to be followed by a referendum about independence in 2011.According to the new 2005 constitution, the bicameral National Legislature is the official Sudanese parliament, and is divided between two chambers; the National Assembly, a lower house with 450 seats, and the Council of States, an upper house with 50 seats. Thus the parliament consists of 500 appointed members altogether, where all are indirectly elected by state legislatures to serve six-year terms.Despite his international arrest warrant, Omar al-Bashir is a candidate in the upcoming 2010 Sudanese presidential election, the first democratic election with multiple political parties participating in nine years.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} His political rival is Vice President Salva Kiir Mayardit, leader of the SPLA and current  President of the autonomous Government of Southern Sudan.SPLM Kiir to run for president in Sudan 2009 elections, Sudan Tribune, 27 July 2008 There is considerable concern amongst the international community of a return to violence in the run-up to the referendum on the CPA in January.\u000aForeign relations{{Main}}\u000aSudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbours and much of the international community owing to what is viewed as its aggressively Islamic stance. For much of the 1990s, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia formed an ad-hoc alliance called the "Front Line States" with support from the United States to check the influence of the National Islamic Front government. The Sudanese Government supported anti-Uganda rebel groups such as the Lord''s Resistance Army.Beginning from the mid-1990s Sudan gradually began to moderate its positions as a result of increased US pressure following the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and the new development of oil fields previously in rebel hands. Sudan also has a territorial dispute with Egypt over the Hala''ib Triangle. Since 2003, the foreign relations of Sudan have centred on the support for ending the Second Sudanese Civil War and condemnation of government support for militias in the Darfur conflict.The United States has listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993. U.S. firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997. In 1998, the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum was destroyed by a US cruise missile strike because of its alleged production of chemical weapons and links to al-Qaeda. Sudan has extensive economic relations with China. China gets 10% of its oil from Sudan, and according to a former Sudanese government minister, China is Sudan\u2019s largest supplier of arms.Goodman, Peter S., China Invests Heavily In Sudan\u2019s Oil Industry, Washington Post, 23 December 2004On 23 December 2005, Chad, Sudan''s neighbour to the west, declared war on Sudan and accused the country of being the "common enemy of the nation [Chad]." This happened after the 18 December attack on Adr\u00e9, which left about 100 people dead. A statement issued by Chadian government on 23 December, accused Sudanese militias of making daily incursions into Chad, stealing cattle, killing people and burning villages on the Chadian border.

These forces are under the command of the National Assembly and its strategic principles include defending Sudan\u2019s external borders and preserve internal security.However, since the Darfur crisis in 2004, safe-keeping the central government from the armed resistance and rebellion of paramilitary rebel groups such as the Sudan People''s Liberation Army (SPLA), the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) have been important priorities.

However, the amount of war prisoners being forced into slavery increased significantly during and after the Second Sudanese Civil War, as Omar al-Bashir seized power in 1989 and created a totalitarian federal government supporting Arab militias terrorizing the southern regions, such as raiding non-Afro Arab villages and looting them both for property and for slaves.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}} Since 1995, international rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and CASMAS have reported that slavery in Sudan is a common fate of captives in the Second Sudanese Civil War and rebels fighting in the Sudan People''s Liberation Army in connections to the Darfur conflict, while the 2002 report issued by the International Eminent Persons Group, acting with the encouragement of the United States State Department, found the SPLA and pro-government militias guilty of abduction of civilians as well.{{cite web}}While the government of the Republic of Sudan denies the allegations of slavery in the country, claiming that these reports are attempts to shed a bad light on Muslims and Arabs, and that slave redemption programmes are fraudulent attempts to make money, the Rift Valley Institute''s Sudan Abductee Database claim over 11,000 people were abducted in 20 years of slave-raiding in the southern regions,{{cite news}} while SudanActivism.com mentions that hundreds of thousands have been abducted into slavery, fled, or are otherwise unaccounted for in a second genocide in southern Sudan.{{cite web}}A letter dated 14 August 2006, from the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch found that the Sudanese government is both incapable of protecting its own citizens in Darfur and unwilling to do so, and that its militias are guilty of crimes against humanity.

These gains, along with improvements to monetary policy, have stabilized the exchange rate.Currently oil is Sudan''s main export, and the production is increasing dramatically. With rising oil revenues the Sudanese economy is booming, with a growth rate of about 9% in 2007. Sustained growth was expected the next year{{When}} due to not only increasing oil production, but also to the boost of hydroelectricity (annual electricity yield of 5.5 TWh) provided by the Merowe Dam.\u000aRich mineral resources are available in Sudan including: petroleum, natural gas, gold, silver, chrome, asbestos, manganese, gypsum, mica, zinc, iron, lead, uranium, copper, kaolin, cobalt, granite, nickel,tin,aluminum.Agriculture production remains Sudan''s most important sector, employing 80% of the workforce and contributing 39% of GDP, but most farms remain rain-fed and susceptible to drought. Instability,adverse weather, and weak world agricultural prices\u2014ensures that much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years.The Merowe Dam, also known as Merowe Multi-Purpose Hydro Project or Hamdab Dam, is a large construction project in Northern Sudan, about 350&nbsp;km north of the capital Khartoum. It is situated on the River Nile, close to the Fourth Cataract where the river divides into multiple smaller branches with large islands in between. Merowe is a city about 40&nbsp;km downstream from the construction site at Hamdab.The main purpose of the dam will be the generation of electricity. Its dimensions make it the largest contemporary hydro power project in Africa. The construction of the dam was to be finished by mid-2008, supplying more than 90% of the population with electricity. Other gas-powered generating stations are under construction in Khartoum state; these were also due to be completed by 2008.Despite the American sanctions, the Sudanese economy is one of the fastest growing in the world according to a New York Times report of October 2006.{{cite news}}\u000aDemographics\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a{{Main}}\u000aIn Sudan''s 1993 census, the population was recorded to be 25 million. No comprehensive census has been carried out since then owing to the continuation of the civil war. A 2006 United Nations estimate put the population at about 37 million. The population of metropolitan Khartoum (including Khartoum, Omdurman, and Khartoum North) is growing rapidly and is estimated at about 5 to 7 million, including around 2 million displaced persons from the southern war zone as well as western and eastern drought-affected areas.Despite being a refugee-generating country, Sudan also hosts a refugee population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, 310,500 refugees and asylum seekers lived in Sudan in 2007. The majority of this population came from Eritrea (240,400 persons), Chad (45,000), Ethiopia (19,300) and the Central African Republic (2,500).{{cite news}} The Sudanese government was reportedly uncooperative with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 2007, and the government forcibly deported at least 1,500 refugees and asylum seekers during the year. Sudan is a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.\u000aEthnic groupsSudan has 597 tribes that speak over 400 different languages and dialects Peter K. Bechtold, `More Turbulence in Sudan` in Sudan: State and Society in Crisis, ed. John Voll (Boulder, Westview, 1991) p.1 split into two major  Ethnic groups: Arabs of the largely Muslim Northern Sudan versus the largely Christian and animist Nilote Southern Sudan of the south. These two groups consist of hundreds of smaller ethnic and tribal divisions, and in the latter case, language groups.As with Moroccans, Algerians and most other non-Arabian Peninsula Arabs, most Sudanese Arabs are "Arabs" in linguistic, cultural and ethnic association. They descended primarily from the pre-existing indigenous populations; that is, the ancient Nubians. The Nubians share a common history with Egypt. In common with much of the rest of the Arab World, the gradual process of Arabisation in northern Sudan led to the predominance of the Arabic language and aspects of Arab culture,{{cite web}} leading to the shift among a majority of northern Sudanese today to an Arab ethnic identity. This process was furthered both by the spread of Islam and an emigration to Sudan of genealogical Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula, and their intermarriage with the Arabized indigenous peoples of the country.The northern states cover most of Sudan and include most of the urban centres. Most of the 22 million Sudanese who live in this region are Arabic-speaking Muslims, though the majority also use a traditional non-Arabic mother tongue (e.g. Nubian, Beja, Fur, Nuban, Ingessana, etc.) as education is in Arabic language. Among these are several distinct tribal groups: the camel-raising Kababish of northern Kordofan; the Dongolawiyin (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0648\u064a\u064a\u0646); the Ga\u2019aliyin (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0646); the Rubatab (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0637\u0627\u0628); the Manasir (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0631); the Shaiqiyah (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0651\u0629); the Bideiria ; the semi-nomadic Baggara of Kurdufan and Darfur; the Beja and Hausa people in the Red Sea area and who extend into Eritrea; and the Nubians of the northern Nile areas, some of whom have been resettled on the Atbara River.Shokrya in the Butana land, Bataheen bordering the Ga\u2019alin and Shokrya in the southwest of Butana. Rufaa, Halaween, Fulani (\u0641\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a) and many other tribes have settled in the Gazeera region and on the banks of the Blue Nile, Damazine and the Dindir region. The Nuba of southern Kurdufan and Fur in the western reaches of the country.The southern region has a population of around six million and a predominantly rural, subsistence economy. This region has been affected by war for all but 10 years since the country''s independence in 1956, resulting in serious neglect, lack of infrastructure development, and major destruction and displacement. More than two million people have died, and more than four million are internally displaced or have become refugees as a result of the civil war and war-related impacts.Here a majority of the population practices traditional indigenous beliefs, although some practice Christianity, a result of Christian missionary efforts. The south also contains many tribal groups and many more languages are used than in the north. The Dinka, whose population is estimated at more than one million, are the largest of the many ethnic groups of Sudan. Along with the Shilluk, also the Nuer and the Bari who consist of five other tribes, Pojulu, Mundari, Kuku, Kakaw and Ngangwara are Nilotic tribes.The Azande, Bor, and Jo Luo are \u201cSudanic\u201d tribes in the west, and the Acholi and Lotuhu live in the extreme south, extending into Uganda. Unlike northern Sudan, Arabisation and Islamisation have been limited in the south as the region''s permanent merger with the north is relatively recent, dating back to the union with Egypt in the 19th century. As a result, Arab self-identification amongst people in the south is almost exclusively limited to those of northern Sudanese origin, with the vast majority of southern Sudanese rejecting Arab identity.\u000aLanguageThe most used languages are:\u000a\u000aArabic in the north, east, west and middle regions, along with the tribal languages ( if they have another language apart from Arabic).\u000aTribal languages in all Sudan with some educated people speaking English.\u000aThe lingua franca in Southern Sudan is a variant of Arabic called Juba Arabic; the English language is used by the educated elite.Some Western African tribes like the Fallata, also known as Fulani and Hausa, have migrated to Sudan at various times, settling in various regions, mainly in the north, with most speaking Arabic in addition to their native languages.\u000aReligion{{Bar box}}{{Main}}\u000a{{See}}\u000aAccording to the CIA Factbook, an estimated 70% of the population adheres to Islam,Identity Politics: Filling the Gap Between Federalism and Independence, By Martin J. Dent, pg. 154CIA - The World Factbook -- Sudan while the remainder of the population follows either animist and indigenous beliefs (25%) or Christianity (5%).Religion in Sudan according to the CIA World Factbook However, these figures appear outdated as about 70% of southern Sudanese, and about 16-20% of the overall population of Sudan, are now affiliated with Christian churches. Sudan''s largest Christian denominations are the following: the Roman Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, the Presbyterian Church in the Sudan, and the Coptic Orthodox Church.{{cite web}} Southern Sudan has one of the fastest growing Christian populations in the world; new churches in the South are being built very frequently.\u000aIslam predominates in the north, while traditional indigenous beliefs (animism) and Christianity are prevalent in the south. Some Muslim leaders estimate the Muslim population to be more than 32 million, or above 80 percent of the total population, this is very debatable, as before Egyptian colonisation, the majority or almost all of the population of Sudan were Christians. Almost all Muslims are Sunni, although there are significant distinctions between followers of different Sunni traditions. Two popular divisions, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist Parties, respectively. There is a small Shi''a community.Christians are now the second largest group. The Roman Catholic Church estimates the number of baptised Catholics at six million, including small Melkite and Maronite communities in the north. Anglicans estimate five million followers in the Episcopal Church of Sudan and the recently formed Reformed Episcopal Church. The Presbyterians are mainly in the Nuer and Chollo tribes. There are significant but long established groups of Orthodox Christians in Khartoum and other northern cities, including Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Christians.There are also Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox communities in Khartoum and eastern Sudan, largely made up of refugees and migrants. Other Christian groups with smaller followings in the country include the Africa Inland Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Sudan Church of Christ, the Sudan Interior Church, Jehovah''s Witnesses, the Sudan Pentecostal Church, the Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church (in the North), and the Seventh-day Adventist Church of Sudan. In January 2010, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints gained its first official presence in Sudan, opening its first branch in the south of the country.{{cite web}}{{Verify credibility}}Foreign missionary groups operate in both North and South, although Christian missionary activity is limited in the North owing to Shari''a, strong social pressure against proselytizing, and existing laws against apostasy.Traditionalists are believed to be the third largest religious division in the country having declined from perhaps 90% of the southern population in 1960 to 30% today as a result of major growth of Christianity fuelled by war and anti-Arab sentiment.Many Christians in the north are descended from pre-Islamic era communities or are trading families that immigrated from Egypt or the Near East before independence (1956). Many Muslims in the south are shopkeepers or small business owners who sought economic opportunities during the civil war. Political tensions have created not only a sense of ethnic and religious marginalisation among the minority religious group in each region but also a feeling among the majority that the minority groups control a disproportionate share of the wealth.Religious identity plays a role in the country''s political divisions. Northern Muslims have dominated the country''s political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from Islamists, Salafis/Wahhabis and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The Umma Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar Sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi brotherhood, as well as some northern Arabic-speaking Christians. Southern Christians generally support the SPLM or one of the smaller southern parties.{{cite web}}\u000aPeople of Sudan\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAbabda\u000aAbddallab\u000aAcholi\u000aArakeien\u000aAshraf\u000aAzande\u000aBaggara\u000aBari\u000aBataheen\u000aBeja\u000aBerti\u000aBideiria Dahmshiia\u000aChollo\u000aDanagla\u000a \u000a\u000aDinka\u000aFulbe\u000aFur\u000aGaalin\u000aGoran (Toubou)\u000aHalfaween\u000aHamar\u000aHausa\u000aHasania\u000aHorefaen\u000aHawara\u000aJa''Alin\u000akakwa\u000a \u000a\u000aKinouz\u000aKuku\u000aLahaweyen\u000aLuo\u000aMabaan\u000aMadi\u000aMahas\u000aManasir\u000aMasalit\u000aMundari\u000aNuba\u000aNubian\u000a \u000a\u000aNuer\u000aNyangwara\u000aNymang\u000aPojulu\u000aRashaida\u000aRubatab\u000aShaigiya\u000aShilluk\u000aShokrya\u000aSudanese Arabs\u000aTama people\u000aZande\u000aZaghawa\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aPeople  Location \u000aAnuak  south central \u000aBari  Juba \u000aDidinga  east \u000aFula (Fulani)  Blue Nile, East and Tulus \u000aKakwa  southwest \u000aLotuko  east \u000aMadi \u000aMahas  north \u000aNyangwara  &#34;Rokon, south sudan&#34; \u000aPari  east \u000aPojulu   Juba, Yei and Lainya \u000aShilluk  east \u000aToposa \u000aLanguages\u000a{{See also}}\u000aAccording to the first authoritative Ethnologue, the total number of languages used or spoken in Sudan is 142.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(66,0,'{{unreferenced}}Transnationalism is a social movement grown out of the heightened interconnectivity between people and the loosening of boundaries between countries.The term was coined in the early 20th century by writer Randolph Bourne to describe a new way of thinking about relationships between cultures.Transnationalism as an economic process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs.  Economic transnationalism, commonly known as Globalization was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization.  Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that Multinational Corporations seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.Proponents of transnationalism seek to facilitate the flow of people, ideas, and goods between regions. They believe that it has increasing relevance with the rapid growth of globalization. They contend that it does not make sense to link specific nation-state boundaries with for instance migratory workforces, globalized corporations, global money flow, global information flow, and global scientific cooperation.Transnationalism designates a recent shift in migration patterns. Migration used to be a rather directed movement with a point of departure and a point of arrival. It is nowadays increasingly turning into an ongoing movement between two or more social spaces. Facilitated by increased global transportation and telecommunication technologies, more and more migrants have developed strong transnational ties to more than one home country, blurring the congruence of social space and geographic space.Diasporas, such as the overseas Chinese, are a historical precursor to modern transnationalism. However, unlike people with transnationalist lives, most diasporas have not been voluntary. The field of diaspora politics does consider modern diasporas as having the potential to be transnational political actors.\u000aTransnationalism vs. internationalismVery careful distinctions are now being made between international or multinational relationships - between and among nation-states or agents thereof{{Dubious}}  - and transnational relationships between and among individuals and other entities, regardless of nation-state boundaries.Internationalism refers to global co-operation between nation states{{Dubious}}, and points to the affairs between nation-state governments, while transnationalism refers to global co-operation between people, and points to activities, which transcends national boundaries and in which nation-state governments do not play the most important or even a significant role.Furthermore transnationalism often entails a vision of the obliteration of nation states to make way for a unified world government. Transnationalism is closely related to cosmopolitanism. If transnationalism describes the individual experience, cosmopolitanism is the philosophy behind it.Examples of internationalism include United Nations, international treaties, international customs and tariffs regulations. Examples of transnationalism include NGOs such as Greenpeace or M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, global financial activities, global science research, and global environmental concerns.\u000aSee also\u000a\u000a\u000aList of transnational organizations\u000a\u000aM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res\u000aNonviolent Radical Party, Transnational and Transparty\u000aGreenpeace\u000aThe NSK State\u000aNational Alliance of Latin American and Caribbean Communities\u000aEuropean Alternatives\u000aThe Transnational Republic\u000aWorld Diaspora Organization\u000aRoman Catholic Church\u000aNo Border network\u000a\u000a\u000aFurther reading\u000a\u000aAppadurai, Arjun: Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, Delhi, India, Oxford University Press, 1997 - is critical of the construct of the nation-state and seek to propagate a greater use of transnational thought.\u000aBarkan, Elliott Robert, ed.: Immigration, Incorporation and Transnationalism, Somerset, New Jersey, USA, Transaction Publishers, 2003.\u000aBourne, Randolph: "Trans-National America" in The Atlantic Monthly, #118 (July 1916), pp.\u00a086\u201397, Boston, The Atlantic Monthly Group, 1916.\u000a{{cite book}}\u000aDolby, Nadine and Cornbleth, Catherine.

Such a conflict is always an attempt at altering either the psychological hierarchy or the material hierarchy of domination or equality between two or more groups.  In all cases, at least one participant (group) in the conflict perceives the need to either psychologically or materially dominate the other participant.  Amongst humans, the perceived need for domination often arises from the belief that an essential ideology or resource is somehow either so incompatible or so scarce as to threaten the fundamental existence of the one group experiencing the need to dominate the other group.  Leaders will sometimes enter into a war under the pretext that their actions are primarily defensive, however when viewed objectively, their actions may more closely resemble a form of unprovoked, unwarranted, or disproportionate aggression.In all wars, the group(s) experiencing the need to dominate other group(s) are unable and unwilling to accept or permit the possibility of a relationship of fundamental equality to exist between the groups who have opted for group violence (war).  The aspect of domination that is a precipitating factor in all wars, i.e. one group wishing to dominate another, is also often a precipitating factor in individual one-on-one violence outside of the context of war, i.e. one individual wishing to dominate another.{{cite web}} Analysis of common roots of violence between Nazis and serial killers.In 2003, Nobel Laureate Richard E. Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years.  In the 1832 book "On War", by Prussian military general and theoretician Carl Von Clausewitz, the author refers to war as the "continuation of political intercourse, carried on with other means."Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.87 War is an interaction in which two or more opposing forces have a \u201cstruggle of wills\u201d.Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976) p.77 The term is also used as a metaphor for non-military conflict, such as in the example of class war.War has generally been considered to be a seemingly inescapable and integral aspect of human culture, its practice not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his History Of Warfare, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.Keegan, John, (1994) "A History Of Warfare", (Pimlico)  The conduct of war extends along a continuum, from the almost universal primitive local tribal warfare that began well before recorded human history, to advanced nuclear warfare between global alliances, with the recently developed ultimate potential for human extinction. More recently, other experts Douglas P. Fry and Judith Hand have argued that war only emerges in certain types of societies or cultures, being rare or absent, for example , in nomadic foragers societies and becoming common when humans take up settled living, particularly at the Agricultural Revolution.\u000aEtymology and scopeFrom late Old English (c.1050), wyrre, werre, from Old North French werre "war" (Fr. guerre), from Frankish *werra, from Proto-Germanic *werso (Compare with Old Saxon werran, Old high German werran, German verwirren "to confuse, perplex"). Cognates suggest the original sense was "to bring into confusion."There was no common Germanic word for "war" at the dawn of historical times. Spanish, Portuguese, Italian guerra are from the same source; Romanic peoples turned to Germanic for a word to avoid Latin "bellum" because its form tended to merge with bello- "beautiful."{{cite web}}In an organized military sense, a group of combatants and their support is called an army on land, a navy at sea, and an air force in the air. Wars may be conducted simultaneously in one or more different theaters. Within each theater, there may be one or more consecutive military campaigns. A military campaign includes not only fighting but also intelligence, troop movements, supplies, propaganda, and other components.  A period of continuous intense conflict is traditionally called a battle, although this terminology is not always applied to conflicts involving aircraft, missiles or bombs alone, in the absence of ground troops or naval forces. Also many other actions may be undertaken by military forces during a war, this could include weapons research, prison internment, assassination, occupation, and in some cases genocide may occur.A civil war is a war between factions of citizens of one country (such as in the English Civil War), or else a dispute between two nations that were created out of one formerly united country. A proxy war is a war that results when two powers use third parties as substitutes for fighting each other directly.\u000aHistory of warfare{{Main}}\u000aBefore the dawn of history war likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a Nubian cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.Keeley: War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago,Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare.In War Before Civilization, Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the University of Illinois, says that approximately 90\u201395% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,Review: War Before Civilization and many fought constantly.{{cite news}} Despite the undeniable carnage and effectiveness of modern warfare, the evidence shows that tribal warfare is on average 20 times more deadly than 20th century warfare. At one battle lost in 1857 among the Mohave-Yumas, 49.6% of combatants were killed; in a great Aztec battle fought in 1478, 87.1% of 24,000 combatants were killed, while 100% of combatants were killed during the Blackfoot Indian raid which annihilated the Assiniboins in 1849."Genocide: a history". W. D. Rubinstein (2004). p.12. ISBN 0-582-50601-8\u000aThe Human Security Report 2005 documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management''s "Peace and Conflict" study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.Hewitt, Joseph, J. Wilkenfield and T. nevertheless the concept war is more than just a word but a signification to the meaning Death. Gurr Peace and Conflict 2008, Paradigm Publishers, 2007Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its potential destructiveness (see Mutual assured destruction), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may hopefully altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III.  At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized in the forms of the League of Nations, and its successor, the United Nations. Shortly after World War II, as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations.\u000aDuring this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former US Department of War was renamed as the US Department of Defense.In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of , and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, the initial developer of the concept of this bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." {{cite web}} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper\u000aFortunately, the anticipated costs of a possible third world war are currently no longer deemed as acceptable by most, thus little motivation currently seems to exist on an international level for such a war.\u000aMotivations\u000aMotivations for war may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For a state to prosecute a war it must have the support of its leadership, its military forces, and its people. For example, in the Third Punic War, Rome''s leaders may have wished to make war with Carthage for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations.The Jewish Talmud describes in the BeReshit Rabbah commentary on the fight between Cain and Abel (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) that there are three universal reasons for wars: A) Economic, B) Ideological/religious, and C) Power/pride/love (personal).{{cite web}} Analysis of Midrash re: Cain & AbelIn Why Nations Go to War, by John G. Stoessinger, the author points out that both sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on misperceptions of the enemy''s intentions.As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war. Carl Von Clausewitz said, ''Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.''Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.593.    The one constant factor is war\u2019s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that necessarily follows.\u000aEconomic theoriesThat economic conditions have stimulated war in all ages is a commonplace of history.John Edwin Bakeless "The economic causes of modern war: a study of the period: 1878-1918", Department of political science of Williams college, 1921, page 10Baron Arthur Salter Salter, Arthur Porritt "The causes of war: economic, industrial, racial, religious, scientific, and political", Ayer Publishing, 1969, ISBN  978-0836913729, page 1 In this view wars begin as a pursuit of territory for natural resources and for wealth."Is there any man, is there any woman, let me say any child here that does not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and commercial rivalry?" - Woodrow Wilson, September 11, 1919, St. Louis.The Papers of Woodrow Wilson, Arthur S.

The potential for disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist." - Dwight Eisenhower, Farewell Address, Jan. 17, 1961.\u000aGovernment funded war programs have historically produced some of the most innovative products we know today. The PhDs at the Universities that created things like the transistor were funded by war programs. The Internet (originally called ARPAnet) was an ARPA funded program, a way to communicate over long distances in the case of nuclear destruction. War funded programs created the cell phone as a way for soldiers to communicate easily from within their tanks over long distances.War is also very lucrative for central banks in the sense that governments have to borrow large amounts of money from their central bank, to be repayed with interest which the government collects through income tax. Several conspiracy theories claim that central banking systems like the Federal Reserve are secretly owned by international bankers who understand the economic benefits of war and thus manipulate the public to believe on an imaginary national enemy, whether that is terrorism or climate change in order to initiate the war process.Report from the Iron Mountain, section "The environmental pollution model" (page 6), section "Environmentalism as a substitute for war" (page 9), http://www.freedom-force.org/pdf/Report_from_Iron_Mountain.pdf\u000aMarxist theoriesThe Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the free market and class system. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a world revolution, over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred.\u000aEvolutionary psychologyA distinct branch of the psychological theories of war are the arguments based on evolutionary psychology. This school tends to see war as an extension of animal behaviour, such as territoriality and competition. Animals are naturally aggressive, and in humans this aggression manifests itself as warfare. However, while war has a natural cause, the development of technology has accelerated human destructiveness to a level that is irrational and damaging to the species.  The earliest advocate of this theory was Konrad Lorenz.Lorenz, Konrad On Aggression 1966Biologists studying primate behavior have also added to the debate. Jane Goodall in 1974 documented what she called a war between groups of chimpanzees in the Gombe National Park of Tanzania.See interview with Jane Goodall, KTEH TV 1997, Dec 9, via youtube and see [http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/origins/goodall.html National Geographic Magazine, December 1995\u000aCrusading for Chimps and Humans . . . Jane Goodall], By Peter Miller] (at maricopa.edu)The BBC broadcast what narrator Sir David Attenborough called a ''raid into the territory of their neighbors'' by a group of Chimps in the series Planet Earth.BBC WorldWide, 2008 Dec 16, "Planet Earth" (via youtube)These theories have been criticized by scholars such as John G. Kennedy, who argue that the organized, sustained war of humans differs more than just technologically from the territorial fights between animals. Ashley MontaguMontagu, Ashley (1976), "The Nature of Human Aggression" (Oxford University Press) strongly denies such universalistic instinctual arguments, pointing out that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare.  Thus while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare is not and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.\u000aBehavioral theoriesSome psychologists such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued that human beings are inherently violent.Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby .Personal Aggressiveness and War 1939. This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers their grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies. By this theory the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it{{Citation needed}}.The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein, thought that war was the paranoid or projective \u201celaboration\u201d of mourning.(Fornari 1975) Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our \u201clove need\u201d: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.While these theories may have some general explanatory value about why war exists, they do not explain when or how they occur. Nor do they explain the existence of certain human cultures completely devoid of war.Turnbull, Colin (1987), "The Forest People" (Touchstonbe Books)  If the innate psychology of the human mind is unchanging, these variations are inconsistent. A solution adapted to this problem by certain thinkers such as the psychologist, Franz Alexander is that peace does not really exist. Periods that are seen as peaceful are actually periods of preparation for a later war or when war is suppressed by a state of great power, such as the Pax Britannica.Alexander, Franz. "The Psychiatric Aspects of War and Peace." 1941An additional problem with theories that rest on the will of the general population, is that in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace.Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars. pg. 5 Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.Walsh, Maurice N. War and the Human Race. 1971. He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.Evolutionary biologist and peace ethologist Judith Hand, looking at the proximal causes of war, also argues that a minority of mostly men\u2014so called hyper-alpha males\u2014are the instigators of wars. She argues that while several aspects of biology, particularly male biology, make humans susceptible to making war, war only emerges when cultural conditions favor it. If conditions favoring war were eliminated, she argues, as does anthropologist Douglas P. Fry, war could be eliminated.\u000aSociological theories{{multiple issues}}\u000aSociology has long been very concerned with the origins of war, and many thousands of theories have been advanced, many of them contradictory. Sociology has thus divided into a number of schools. One, the Primat der Innenpolitik (Primacy of Domestic Politics) school based on the works of Eckart Kehr and Hans-Ulrich Wehler, sees war as the product of domestic conditions, with only the target of aggression being determined by international realities. Thus World War I was not a product of international disputes, secret treaties, or the balance of power but a product of the economic, social, and political situation within each of the states involved.This differs from the traditional Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik (Primacy of Foreign Politics) approach of Carl von Clausewitz and Leopold von Ranke that argues it is the decisions of statesmen and the geopolitical situation that leads to peace.\u000aDemographic theories\u000aDemographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and youth bulge theories.\u000aMalthusian theoriesMalthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, wrote, "For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators.  Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife.  Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end.  Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves."This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources.  Thomas Malthus (1766&ndash;1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine.This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the developed world, where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where birth control has dramatically slowed the increase in population.\u000aYouth bulge theory\u000aYouth bulge theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts - as graphically represented as a "youth bulge" in a population pyramid - with a lack of regular, peaceful employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence.While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, ''excess'' young males and available social positions within the existing social system of division of labour.Contributors to the development of youth bulge theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul,Bouthoul, Gaston: "L`infanticide diff\u00e9r\u00e9" (deferred infanticide), Paris 1970 U.S. sociologist Jack A.

But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of 16 and 30.During the 1960s, 70s and 80s there were high birth rates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birth rates are going down; in fact, they have dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don''t think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology."\u2018So, are civilizations at war?\u2019, Interview with Samuel P. Huntington by Michael Steinberger, The Observer, Sunday October 21, 2001.http://observer.guardian.co.uk/islam/story/0,,577982,00.html\u000a\u000aYouth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change".Helgerson, John L. (2002): "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends"http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htmAccording to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4-8 children per woman with a 15-29 year delay.A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a sub-replacement fertility rate leading to population decline.Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4-8 children per mother implies 2-4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many "angry young men" find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are\u000a\u000aDemographically superfluous,\u000aMight be out of work or stuck in a menial job, and\u000aOften have no access to a legal sex life before a career can earn them enough to provide for a family. See: Hypergamy, Waithood.\u000a\u000aThe combination of these stress factors according to HeinsohnHeinsohn, G.(2006): "Demography and War." has typically lead such young men to pursue one of the following six different strategies:\u000a\u000aEmigration (&#34;non violent colonization&#34;)\u000aViolent Crime\u000aRebellion or putsch\u000aCivil war and/or revolution\u000aGenocide (to take over the positions of the slaughtered)\u000aConquest (violent colonization, frequently including genocide abroad).\u000a\u000aReligions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism and today''s "Islamist" civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.Heinsohn, G.(2005): "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century."  http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF With the Gaza Strip now being seen as another example of youth-bulge-driven violence, especially if compared to Lebanon which is geographically close, yet remarkably more peaceful.G.

Given this assumption, if both countries knew in advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of fighting the war.  This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since Carl von Clausewitz, that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack.\u000aRationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility, information asymmetry with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible commitments.Fearon, James D. 1995.  "Rationalist Explanations for War."  International Organization 49, 3: 379-414. http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/fearon-io1995v49n3.pdfIssue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other.  Religious issues, such as control over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as Geoffrey Blainey, is that both sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated.Some go further and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent.  The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each side has military secrets about its own capabilities.  They will not avoid the bargaining failure by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions.  For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that Hermann G\u00f6ring only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.The American decision to enter the Vietnam War was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability to long oppose American forces.Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states'' inability to make credible commitments.Powell, Robert.  2002.  "Bargaining Theory and International Conflict."  Annual Review of Political Science 5: 1-30.  In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds.  The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad.  Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country''s leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship.  Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of the psychological theories above would disagree.Rationalist theories are usually explicated with game theory, for example, the Peace War Game, not a wargame as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.\u000aPolitical science theories{{Refimprovesect}}\u000aThe statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.There are several different international relations theory schools. Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security.\u000aWhich sometimes is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that states that are democracies do not go to war with each other, an idea that has come to be known as the democratic peace theory. Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs, economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others.Another major theory relating to power in international relations and machtpolitik is the Power Transition theory, which distributes the world into a hierarchy and explains major wars as part of a cycle of hegemons being destabilized by a great power which does not support the hegemons'' control.Military adventurism can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.{{cite web}} Leaders may use war as instant popularity boost\u000aMorality of wars{{multiple issues}}Throughout history war has been the source of serious moral questions. Although many ancient nations and some modern ones have viewed war as noble, over the sweep of history, concerns about the morality of war have gradually increased. Today, war is seen by some as undesirable and morally problematic. At the same time, many view war, or at least the preparation and readiness and willingness to engage in war, as necessary for the defense of their country and therefore a just war. Pacifists believe that war is inherently immoral and that no war should ever be fought.The negative view of war has not always been held as widely as it is today. Heinrich von Treitschke saw war as humanity''s highest activity where courage, honour, and ability were more necessary than in any other endeavour. Friedrich Nietzsche also saw war as an opportunity for the \u00dcbermensch to display heroism, honour, and other virtues.{{Citation needed}} However, it is important to note that both Heinrich Von Treitschke and Frederich Nietzsche never participated in any wars due to incidents beforehand. Von Treitschke fell deaf at a young age, preventing him from any military service. Nietzsche endured a tragic riding accident which left him unfit for military service. Also, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Thomas Mann, who are mentioned in the following paragraph, both never participated in any wars either, but are regardless, well known, influential and intelligent philosophers of their time.Another supporter of war, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, favoured it as part of the necessary process required for history to unfold and allow society to progress. At the outbreak of World War I, the writer Thomas Mann wrote, "Is not peace an element of civil corruption and war a purification, a liberation, an enormous hope?" This attitude has been embraced by societies from Sparta and Rome in the ancient world to the fascist states of the 1930s. Support for war continues to this day, especially regarding the notion of a Just War (necessary wars required to halt an aggressor or otherwise dangerous nation or group).International law recognizes only two cases for a legitimate war:\u000a\u000aWars of defense: when one nation is attacked by an aggressor, it is considered legitimate for a nation along with its allies to defend itself against the aggressor.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWars sanctioned by the UN Security Council: when the United Nations as a whole acts as a body against a certain nation. Examples include various peacekeeping operations around the world, as well as the Korean and 1st Gulf Wars.\u000a\u000aThe subset of international law known as the law of war or international humanitarian law also recognises regulations for the conduct of war, including the Geneva Conventions governing the legitimacy of certain kinds of weapons, and the treatment of prisoners of war. Cases where these conventions are broken are considered war crimes, and since the Nuremberg Trials at the end of World War II the international community has established a number of tribunals to try such cases.A nation''s economy is often stimulated by government war-spending. When countries wage war, more weapons, armor, ammunition, and the like are needed to be created and sold to the armies, thus their economies can enter a boom (or war economy) reducing unemployment.\u000aConduct of wars{{Original research}}\u000aThe war, to become known as one, must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other military technology and equipment by armed forces employing military tactics and Operational art within the broad military strategy subject to military logistics. War Studies by military theorists throughout military history have sought to identify the Philosophy of war, and to reduce it to a Military science.In general, modern military science considers several factors before a National defence policy is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.\u000aBehaviour & conduct in war{{rquote}}\u000aThe behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually and as units or armies.  In some circumstances, troops may engage in genocide, war rape and ethnic cleansing.  Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.{{cite book}}.  Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in World War I by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire.Axelrod, Robert. 1984. The Evolution of Cooperation. New York: Basic Books.  Other examples of non-aggression, also from World War I, are detailed in Goodbye to all that.  These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield.  The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of World War I was the Christmas truce.It has been postulated that sport serves as an direct alternative to war, and may be regarded as having an equivalent social function.  Sipes found war and sporting alternatives to be positively correlated.{{cite journal}}The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of Dresden in World War II.{{Citation needed}}  The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities.{{cite book}}\u000aTypes of warfare{{multiple issues}}\u000a\u000aConventional warfare is an attempt to reduce an opponent&#39;s military capability through open battle. It is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of conventional military goals and maneuvers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe opposite of conventional warfare, unconventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNuclear warfare is a war in which nuclear weapons are the primary method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCivil war is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation or political entity.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAsymmetric warfare is a conflict between two populations of drastically different levels of military capability or size.  Asymmetric conflicts often result in guerrilla tactics being used to overcome the sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIntentional air pollution in combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called chemical warfare. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War I, and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries.{{Citation needed}} Various treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such as tear gas and pepper spray, are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.\u000a\u000a\u000aMilitary postureHistorian Victor Davis Hanson has claimed there exists a unique "Western Way of War", in an attempt to explain the military successes of Western Europe.citation needed  It originated in Ancient Greece, where, in an effort to reduce the damage that warfare has on society, the city-states developed the concept of a decisive pitched battle between heavy infantry.  This would be preceded by formal declarations of war and followed by peace negotiations.  In this system constant low-level skirmishing and guerrilla warfare were phased out in favour of a single, decisive contest, which in the end cost both sides less in casualties and property damage.  Although it was later perverted by Alexander the Great?, this style of war initially allowed neighbours with limited resources to coexist and prosper.He argues that Western-style armies are characterised by an emphasis on discipline and teamwork above individual bravado.  Examples of Western victories over non-Western armies include the Battle of Marathon, the Battle of Gaugamela, the Siege of Tenochtitlan, the Battle of Plassey and the defence of Rorke''s Drift.\u000aWarfare environmentThe environment in which a war is fought has a significant impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area different types of terrain. This in turn means that soldiers have to be trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that generally reflects troops'' mobility limitations or enablers.\u000aThese include:\u000a{{Col-begin}}\u000a{{Col-2}}\u000aConventional warfare\u000a\u000aDefensive warfare\u000aOffensive warfare\u000aJungle warfare\u000aBorder warfare a type of limited defensive warfare\u000aUrban warfare\u000aDesert warfare\u000aManeuver warfare\u000aTrench warfare\u000aMountain warfare sometimes called Alpine warfare\u000aArctic warfare or Winter warfare in general\u000aNaval warfare or Aquatic warfare that includes Littoral, Amphibious and Riverine warfare\u000aNapoleonic warfare\u000a{{Col-2}}\u000aUnconventional warfare\u000a\u000aGuerilla warfare\u000aPsychological warfare\u000aBiological warfare\u000aChemical warfare\u000aMine warfare a type of static terrain denial warfare\u000aAir warfare that includes Airborne warfare and Airmobile warfare\u000aSub-aquatic warfare\u000aSpace warfare\u000aElectronic warfare including Radio, Radar and Network warfare\u000aCyber warfare\u000aDirected-energy warfare\u000aNuclear warfare\u000aTribal warfare and gang warfare, which occur on a local or sub-state level\u000a{{Col-end}}\u000aEffects of war\u000aIt is estimated that 378 000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.{{cite journal}}\u000a\u000aOn soldiers{{Quotation1}}Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.{{cite web}} Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.Kitchen, Martin (2000),The Treaty of Versailles and its Consequences, New York: Longman\u000aDuring Napoleon''s retreat from Moscow, more French soldiers died of typhus than were killed by the Russians.The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus.

In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the American Civil War. In some cases war has stimulated a country''s economy (World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the Great Depression) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia''s involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917.\u000aWorld War IIOne of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the Second World War. The Great Depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the war effort.Great Depression and World War II. The Library of Congress. The financial cost of the World War II is estimated at about a $1.944 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide,Mayer, E. (2000) "World War II" course lecture notes on Emayzine.com (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)Coleman, P. (1999) "Cost of the War," World War II Resource Guide (Gardena, California: The American War Library) making it the most costly war in capital as well as lives.Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.The New York Times, 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.\u000aFactors ending a war{{multiple issues}}\u000a\u000aThe political and economic circumstances in the peace that follows war usually depends on the "facts on the ground". Where evenly matched adversaries decide that the conflict has resulted in a stalemate, they may cease hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to restore the antebellum territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory. Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a treaty, such as the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which ended the First World War.A warring party that surrenders or capitulates may have little negotiating power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most of the terms of any treaty.  A common result is that conquered territory is brought under the dominion of the stronger military power.  An unconditional surrender is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to prevent further harm to life and property.  For example, the Empire of Japan gave an unconditional surrender to the Allies of World War II after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (see Surrender of Japan), the preceding massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union.  A settlement or surrender may also be obtained through deception or bluffing.Many other wars, however, have ended in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the Battle of Carthage of the Third Punic War between the Phoenician city of Carthage and Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its citizens, and razed the buildings.Some wars or aggressive actions end when the military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not, especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed prior to the victory of the conqueror.  In such cases, disorganised guerilla warfare may continue for a considerable period.  In cases of complete surrender conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the victorious side.  A raid for the purposes of looting may be completed with the successful capture of goods.  In other cases an aggressor may decide to end hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining the original objective, such as happened in the Iran\u2013Iraq War.Some hostilities, such as insurgency or civil war, may persist for long periods of time with only a low level of military activity.  In some cases there is no negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, or combatants are gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile.\u000aList of wars by death toll{{Merge to}}\u000aThese figures include deaths of civilians from diseases, famine, atrocities etc. as well as deaths of soldiers in battle.This is an incomplete list of wars.\u000a\u000a60,000,000\u201372,000,000 - World War II (1939\u20131945), (see World War II casualties)Wallinsky, David: David Wallechinsky''s Twentieth Century : History With the Boring Parts Left Out, Little Brown & Co., 1996, ISBN 0-316-92056-8, ISBN 978-0-316-92056-8 - cited by WhiteBrzezinski, Zbigniew: Out of Control: Global Turmoil on the Eve of the Twenty-first Century, Prentice Hall & IBD, 1994, ASIN B000O8PVJI - cited by White\u000a36,000,000 - An Shi Rebellion (China, 755\u2013763)Selected Death Tolls for Wars, Massacres and Atrocities Before the 20th Century\u000a30,000,000\u201360,000,000 - Mongol Conquests (13th century) (see Mongol invasions and Tatar invasions)Ping-ti Ho, "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in \u00c9tudes Song, Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33-53.Mongol ConquestsThe world''s worst massacres Whole Earth ReviewBattuta''s Travels: Part Three - Persia and Iraq\u000a25,000,000 - Qing dynasty conquest of Ming dynasty (1616\u20131662)McFarlane, Alan: The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap, Blackwell 2003, ISBN 0-631-18117-2,\u000aISBN 978-0-631-18117-0 - cited by White\u000a\u000a20,000,000 - World War I (1914\u20131918) (see World War I casualties)"Military Casualties of World War One"\u000a20,000,000 - Taiping Rebellion (China, 1851\u20131864) (see Dungan revolt)Taiping Rebellion - Britannica Concise\u000a20,000,000 - Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)Nuclear Power: The End of the War Against Japan\u000a10,000,000 - Warring States Era (China, 475 BC\u2013221 BC)\u000a7,000,000 - 20,000,000 Conquests of Tamerlane (1360\u20131405)Timur Lenk (1369-1405)Matthew''s White''s website (a compilation of scholarly estimates) -Miscellaneous Oriental Atrocities\u000a5,000,000\u20139,000,000 - Russian Civil War and Foreign Intervention (1917\u20131921)Russian Civil War\u000a5,000,000 - Conquests of Menelik II of Ethiopia (1882\u20131898)Oromo IdentityGlories and Agonies of the Ethiopian past\u000a3,800,000 - 5,400,000 - Second Congo War (1998\u20132007)Inside Congo, An Unspeakable TollConflict in Congo has killed 4.7m, charity saysCome Back, Colonialism, All is Forgiven\u000a3,500,000\u20136,000,000 - Napoleonic Wars (1804\u20131815) (see Napoleonic Wars casualties)\u000a3,000,000\u201311,500,000 - Thirty Years'' War (1618\u20131648)The Thirty Years War (1618-48)\u000a3,000,000\u20137,000,000 - Yellow Turban Rebellion (China, 184\u2013205)\u000a2,500,000\u20133,500,000 - Korean War (1950\u20131953) (see Cold War)Cease-fire agreement marks the end of the Korean War on July 27, 1953.\u000a2,300,000\u20133,800,000 - Vietnam War (entire war 1945\u20131975)\u000a300,000\u20131,300,000 - First Indochina War (1945\u20131954)\u000a100,000\u2013300,000 - Vietnamese Civil War (1954\u20131960)\u000a1,750,000\u20132,100,000 - American phase (1960\u20131973)\u000a170,000 - Final phase (1973\u20131975)\u000a175,000\u20131,150,000 - Secret War (1962\u20131975)\u000a2,000,000\u20134,000,000 - Huguenot Wars Huguenot Religious Wars, Catholic vs. Huguenot (1562-1598)\u000a2,000,000 - Shaka&#39;s conquests (1816\u20131828)Shaka: Zulu Chieftain\u000a2,000,000 - Mahmud of Ghazni&#39;s invasions of India (1000\u20131027)K.

INSERT INTO DOCUMENT VALUES(68,0,'{{More footnotes}}\u000a{{Globalize/USA}}\u000aWork-life balance is a broad concept including proper prioritizing between "work" (career and ambition) on one hand and "life" (pleasure, leisure, family and spiritual development) on the other. Related, though broader, terms include "lifestyle balance" and "life balance".\u000aHistoryThe expression was first used in the late 1970s to describe the balance between an individual''s work and personal life.Publication in: New Ways to Work and the Working Mother''s Association in the United Kingdom In the United States, this phrase was first used in 1986. Over the past twenty-five years, there has been a substantial increase in work which is felt to be due, in part, by information technology and by an intense, competitive work environment. Long-term loyalty and a "sense of corporate community" have been eroded by a performance culture that expects more and more from their employees yet offers little security in return.  Many experts predicted that technology would eliminate most household chores and provide people with much more time to enjoy leisure activities; but many ignore this option, encouraged by prevailing consumerist culture and a political agenda that has "elevated the work ethic to unprecedented heights and thereby reinforced the low value and worth attached to parenting".{{Citation needed}}\u000aMany Americans are experiencing burnout due to overwork and increased stress. This condition is seen in nearly all occupations from blue collar workers to upper management.  Over the past decade, a rise in workplace violence, an increase in levels of absenteeism as well as rising workers\u2019 compensation claims are all evidence of an unhealthy work life balance. {{Citation needed}} Employee assistance professionals say there are many causes for this situation ranging from personal ambition and the pressure of family obligations to the accelerating pace of technology.http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400..  According to a recent study for the Center for Work-Life Policy, 1.7 million people consider their jobs and their work hours excessive because of globalization.  These difficult and exhausting conditions are having adverse effects.  According to the study, fifty percent of top corporate executives are leaving their current positions.  Although sixty-four percent of workers feel that their work pressures are "self-inflicted", they state that it is taking a toll on them.  The study shows that seventy percent of US respondents and eighty-one percent of global respondents say their jobs are affecting their health.  Between forty-six and fifty-nine percent of workers feel that stress is affecting their interpersonal and sexual relationships.  Additionally, men feel that there is a certain stigma associated with saying "I can''t do this".\u000aUnited States history{{Main}}\u000aWork statistics\u000aAccording to a survey conducted by the National Life Insurance Company, four out of ten employees state that their jobs are "very" or "extremely" stressful.http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400.  Those in high stress jobs are three times more likely than others to suffer from stress-related medical conditions and are twice as likely to quit.  The study states that women, in particular, report stress related to the conflict between work and family.\u000aStress and work-life balance\u000aThe number of stress-related disability claims by American employees has doubled{{when}} according to the Employee Assistance Professionals Association in Arlington, Virginia. Seventy-five to ninety percent of physician visits are related to stress and, according to the American Institute of Stress, the cost to industry has been estimated at $200 billion-$300 billion a year.http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400  Steven L. Sauter, chief of the Applied Psychology and Ergonomics Branch of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati, Ohio, states that recent studies show that "the workplace has become the single greatest source of stress".http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400.  Michael Feuerstein, professor of clinical psychology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences at Bethesda Naval Hospital states, "We''re seeing a greater increase in work-related neuroskeletal disorders from a combination of stress and ergonomic stressors".http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400 It is clear that problems caused by stress have become a major concern to both employers and employees. Symptoms of stress are manifested both physiologically and psychologically. Persistent stress can result in cardiovascular disease, sexual health problems, a weaker immune system and frequent headaches, stiff muscles, or backache. It can also result in poor coping skills, irritability, jumpiness, insecurity, exhaustion, and difficulty concentrating.  Stress may also perpetuate or lead to binge eating, smoking, and alcohol consumption. According to James Campbell Quick, a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Texas-Arlington, "The average tenure of presidents at land-grant universities in the past ten years has dropped from approximately seven to three-and-a-half years".http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400 The feeling that simply working hard is not enough anymore is acknowledged by many other American workers.  \u201cTo get ahead, a seventy-hour work week is the new standard.  What little time is left is often divvied up among relationships, kids, and sleep.\u201d http://www.msn.com  This increase in work hours over the past two decades means that less time will be spent with family, friends, and community as well as pursuing activities that one enjoys and taking the time to grow personally and spiritually.{{Citation needed}}Texas Quick, an expert witness at trials of companies who were accused of overworking their employees, states that \u201cwhen people get worked beyond their capacity, companies pay the price.\u201d http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400. Although some employers believe that workers should  reduce their own stress by simplifying their lives and making a better effort to care for their health, most experts feel that the chief responsibility for reducing stress should be management.  According to Esther M. Orioli, president of Essi Systems, a stress management consulting firm, \u201cTraditional stress-management programs placed the responsibility of reducing stress on the individual rather than on the organization-where it belongs.  No matter how healthy individual employees are when they start out, if they work in a dysfunctional system, they\u2019ll burn out.\u201d http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/cqresrre1995080400.\u000aWomen and family\u000aGender differences regarding work-life balanceAccording to Sylvia Hewlett, president of the Center for Work-Life Policy, if a woman takes time off to care for children or an older parent, employers tend to \u201csee these people as less than full committed. It\u2019s as though their identity is transformed.\u201d http://www.pbs.org/nbr Brett Graff, Nightly Business Report correspondent states that (because a woman may have trouble re-entering the market or, if she does find a position, it will likely be a lower position with less pay). \u201cIf you thought choosing a baby name was hard, you have yet to wrestle with the idea of leaving your career to be a full-time mom or take care of an older parent\u2026Most will want to reenter, but will do so accepting lesser positions or lower wages.\u201d http://www.pbs.org/nbr  This circumstance only increases the work-life balance stress experienced by many women employees.Research conducted by the Kenexa Research Institute (KRI), a division of Kenexa, evaluated how male and female workers perceive work-life balance and found that women are more positive than men in how they perceive their company\u2019s efforts to help them balance work and life responsibilities. The report is based on the analysis of data drawn from a representative sample of 10,000 U.S. workers who were surveyed through WorkTrends, KRI\u2019s annual survey of worker opinions. The results indicated a shift in women\u2019s perceptions about work-life balance. In the past, women often found it more difficult to maintain balance due to the competing pressures at work and demands at home. http://www.kenexa.com/en/AboutUs/Press/2007/07JUL25.aspx\u000aWork-life balance concerns of men and women alikeSimilar discrimination is experienced by men who take time off or reduce working hours for taking care of the family.For many employees today\u2014both male and female\u2014their lives are becoming more consumed with a host of family and other personal responsibilities and interests. Therefore, in an effort to retain employees, it is increasingly important for organizations to recognize this balance. http://www.kenexa.com/en/AboutUs/Press/2007/07JUL25.aspx\u000aWork-life balance issues and their influence on childrenAn increasing number of young children are being raised by a childcare provider or another person other than a parent; older children are more likely today to come home to an empty house and spend time with video games, television and the internet with less guidance to offset or control the messages coming from these sources. No one knows how many kids are home after school without an adult, but they know the number is in the millions. Also, according to a study by the National Institute of  Child Health and Human Development, the \u201cmore time that children spent in child care, the more likely their sixth grade teachers were to report problem behavior.\u201d http://www.abcnews.go.com/health  The findings are the results of the largest study of child care and development conducted in the United States; the analysis tracked 1,364 children from birth.\u000aResponsibility of the employer\u000aCompanies have begun to realize how important the work-life balance is to the productivity and creativity of their employees. Research by Kenexa Research Institute in 2007 shows that those employees who were more favorable toward their organization\u2019s efforts to support work-life balance also indicated a much lower intent to leave the organization, greater pride in their organization, a willingness to recommend it as a place to work and higher overall job satisfaction.Employers can offer a range of different programs and initiatives, such as flexible working arrangements in the form of part time, casual and telecommuting work. More proactive employers can provide compulsory leave, strict maximum hours and foster an environment that encourages employees not to continue working after hours. It is generally only highly skilled workers that can enjoy such benefits as written in their contracts, although many professional fields would not go so far as to discourage workaholic behaviour. Unskilled workers will almost always have to rely on bare minimum legal requirements. The legal requirements are low in many countries, in particular, the United States. In contrast, the European Union has gone quite far in assuring a legal work-life balance framework, for example pertaining to parental leave and the non-discrimination of part-time workers.\u000aGlobal comparisonsAccording to a new study by Harvard and McGill University researchers, the United States lags far behind nearly all wealthy countries when it comes to family-oriented workplace policies such as maternity leave, paid sick days and support for breast feeding. Jody Heyman, founder of the Harvard-based Project on Global Working Families and director of McGill\u2019s Institute for Health and Social Policy, states that, \u201cMore countries are providing the workplace protections that millions of Americans can only dream of. The U.S. has been a proud leader in adopting laws that provide for equal opportunity in the workplace, but our work/family protections are among the worst.\u201d http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16907584/ This observation is being shared by many Americans today and is considered by many experts to be indicative of the current climate.  However, the U.S. Labor Department is examining regulations that give workers unpaid leave to deal with family or medical emergencies (a review that supporters of the FMLA worry might be a prelude to scaling back these protections, as requested by some business groups).  At the same time, Senator Chris Dodd from Connecticut is proposing new legislation that would enable workers to take six weeks of paid leave.  Congress is also expected to reconsider the Healthy Families Act which is a bill that would require employers with at least fifteen employees to provide seven paid sick days per year. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16907584/At the state level, California has paid family leave benefits for its workers.  New Jersey lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make their state the second state to add this worker benefit.  Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state\u2019s temporary disability insurance fund, \u201caugmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers\u2019 weekly wages.\u201d Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change.  Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National Pro-Life Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having abortions. According to Heyman, \u201cAcross the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families.  If you look at the most competitive economies in the world, all the others except the U.S. have these policies in place.\u201d http://www.msn.comThe United States is not as workplace family-oriented as many other wealthy countries.  According to a study released by Harvard and McGill University researchers in February 2007, workplace policies for families in the U.S. are weaker than those of all high-income countries and even many middle-and low-income countries. For example, the study notes that the United States is one of only five countries out of 173 that does not guarantee some form of paid maternity leave. (The other countries are Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland, and Papua New Guinea).  Other differences include the fact that fathers are granted paid paternity leave or paid parental leave in sixty-five countries; thirty one of these countries offer at least fourteen weeks of paid leave.  The U.S. does not guarantee this to fathers.  At least 107 countries protect working women\u2019s right to breast-feed and, in at least seventy-three of them, women are paid. The U.S. does not have any federal legislation guaranteeing mothers the right to breast-feed their infants at work.  When it comes to sick days, 145 countries provide sick days to their employees; 127 provide a week or more per year.  There is not a federal law requiring paid sick days in the United States. At least 134 countries have laws setting the maximum length of the work week; the U.S. does not have a maximum work week length and does not place any limits on the amount of overtime that an employee is required to work each week. (survey) Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the highest level of maternity benefits\u2014Sweden provides 68 weeks paid maternity leave, Norway provides 56 weeks paid maternity leave and Denmark provides 52. http://www.hrmguide.co.ukAmerican workers average approximately ten paid holidays per year while British workers average twenty-five holidays and German employees thirty. Americans work twelve weeks more a year in total hours than Europeans.{{Citation needed}}In Europe, the Working Time Regulation has implemented a maximum of forty-eight hours of work per week. http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/industrialrelations/dictionary/definitions/WORKINGTIME.htm  Many countries have opted for fewer hours. France attempted to introduce a thirty-five hour workweek, and Finland experimented with a thirty-hour week in 1996.{{Citation needed}}  In a 2007, the European Quality of Life Survey found that countries in south-eastern Europe had the most common problems with work-life balance.  In Croatia and Greece, a little over 70% of working citizens say that they are too tired to do household jobs at least several times a month because of work.  http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/2007/index.htmIn Britain, legislation has been passed allowing parents of children under six to request a more flexible work schedule.  Companies must approve this request as long as it does not damage the business. A 2003 Survey of graduates in the UK revealed that graduates value flexibility even more than wages. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7984202.stmIn all twenty-five European countries, voters \u201cpunish\u201d politicians who try to shrink vacations.  \u201cEven the twenty-two days Estonians, Lithuanians, Poles and Slovenians count as their own is much more generous than the leave allotted to U.S. workers.\u201d http://www.ergoweb.com According to a report by the Families and Work Institute, the average vacation time that Americans took each year averaged 14.6 days. Even when vacation time is offered in some U.S. companies, some choose not to take advantage of it.  A 2003 survey by Management Recruiter International stated that fifty percent of executives surveyed didn\u2019t have plans to take a vacation.  They decided to stay at work and use their vacation time to get caught up on their increased workloads. http://www.ergoweb.com\u000aSee also\u000a\u000aMoney-rich, time-poor\u000aOn-Ramping\u000aPersonal life\u000aTime bind\u000aWorkaholic\u000a\u000aStress related:\u000a\u000aWorkplace stress\u000aPsychoneuroimmunology\u000aStress (biological)\u000aBurnout (psychology)\u000aOccupational health psychology\u000a\u000aLabour:\u000a\u000aLabour law\u000aLabour market flexibility\u000a\u000aOther:\u000a\u000aDeath from overwork (Japan)\u000aMedical resident work hours\u000aSuperwoman (sociology)\u000a\u000a\u000aResourcesArizona State University''s Hugh Downs School of Human Communication has a strategic initiative called the Project for Wellness and Work Life. From its website:\u000a"The Project for Wellness and Work-Life (PWWL) is a consortium of scholars who are pursuing research on the intersections of private, domestic life spheres and the public, commodified world of work. Furthermore, we examine organizational topics related to work-life well-being including workplace bullying, emotion labor, burnout, negotiation of gender and family issues and identities at work.  PWWL explores these issues from a variety of perspectives, including: How work-life balance is interactionally negotiated between family members at home and with supervisors at work; how organizational policies enable and constrain work-life wellness choices; and how larger cultural discourses frame our understanding and experience of work and life."More information can be found at: http://www.asu.edu/clas/communication/about/wellness/The Quality of Life Research Center (QLRC) at the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University is a non-profit research institute that is currently conducting research jointly with Harvard and Stanford Universities on the conditions that make good work in the professions possible. From their website: "The Quality of Life Research Center (QLRC) studies "positive psychology"; that is, human strengths such as optimism, creativity, intrinsic motivation, and responsibility.In the past, the study of behavior has focused mainly on what goes wrong in human affairs: aggression, mental disease, failure and hopelessness. While it is essential to study and contain such pathologies, it is equally important to understand those aspects of human experience that make life worth living. The QLRC conducts research on such issues, and provides a forum for scholars from the U.S. and abroad who wish to extend their studies in positive psychology."More information can be found at: http://qlrc.cgu.edu/about.htmThe Sloan Work and Family Research Network at Boston College offers a vast amount of information about work-life balance topics offering free resources to academics, workplace practitioners and state legislators as well as other interested in these issues.

More information can be found at: http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/index.phpThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health launched in 2004 what it termed the NIOSH WorkLife Initiative. This initiative seeks to establish effective workplace programs to sustain and improve worker health. It focuses on identifying and supporting comprehensive approaches to reduce workplace hazards and promote worker health and well being. The premise of this initiative is that comprehensive practices and policies that take into account the work environment\u2014both physical and organizational\u2014while also addressing the personal health risks of individuals, are more effective in preventing disease and promoting health and safety than each approach taken separately.http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/worklife/essentials.html The NIOSH WorkLife Initiative is notable as it represents a U.S. government agency''s recognition of the nation''s need to develop a culture of work-life balance among its workers.More information can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/worklife/Jeff Davidson, the Work-Life Balance Expert \u00ae, operates out of Raleigh, North Carolina.
