    * ~~Consolidate fonts to (ideally) three different sizes.~~ 
    * ~~Decrease number of other treatments.~~
 * ~~Update jquery-ui themes.~~
 * Add "corporate" links:
    * Tagline: Connecting colleagues with shared interests. (put this under logo?)
    * Other information: Macademia is developed by students at Macalester College under the direction of Shilad Sen.  The project is funded by Macalester College, the National Science Foundation, and The Associated Colleges of the Midwest.

    * Fix spacing
    * ~~Should "cancel" be a button?~~
    * Use jquery-ui button for register?   
 * ~~Use consistent vertical dividers on the right hand nav~~(initial instructions still use a different divider, but that is only shown on the 'home page load', and I felt it looks best with it's current divider)
 * ~~Bold the root node by default~~
 * Add "edit profile" links to person view on right nav when relevant
