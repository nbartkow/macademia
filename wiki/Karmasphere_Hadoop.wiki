== Wikipedia Hadoop ==
Karmasphere is a Hadoop plugin for Netbeans. It allows programmers to
interact with the Hadoop filesystem and run jobs. We are using it to
calculate the similarity of our wikipedia pages.

== Installing Karmasphere == 
  * Install Netbeans (http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html -choose the java version)
  * In Netbeans go to plugins  and clique settings
  * On settings click the button add and enter the following information
  * Name: "Karmasphere for Hadoop" and URL: "http://hadoopstudio.org/updates/updates.xml"
  * Click ok and go to available plugins tab and search for karmasphere
  * About four items will appear on the results, click all of them and press install
  
== Checking out the project ==
  * On Netbeans click on team and choose svn
  * Choose checkout and the URL is "http://poliwiki.macalester.edu/svn/research"
  * Enter your username and password and checkout the wikiMiner project, under macademia
  * Create a Java Project with Existing Sources
  * When asked to add source folders, choose the existing folder containing the wikiMiner project
  * Continue to the finish

== Setting up the Amazon Account ==
  * On Netbeans click on the services tab
  * Under Hadoop, right click on Amazon Accounts and choose New Amazon Account
  * Fill out the remaining information as directed by Shilad 

== Keypairs ==
  * Keypairs can be created by using Amazon's Control Panel under EC2/Key Pairs

== Setting up the HDFS service in Netbeans ==
  * On Netbeans click on the services tab
  * Under Hadoop, right click on Remote Clusters and choose New HDFS Filesystem
  * Enter the Filesystem Name "Wikipedia_Hadoop"
  * Click on HDFS and click next
  * Enter the NameNode host "mist.public.stolaf.edu"; port: 9000, your username and group
  * Press next and enter proxy type: "SSH TUNNEL", enter the SSH private key (see next section)
  * Press Finish
  * The new filesystem will appear under Hadoop Filesystems
  * Right click on it and press browse to see files

== Generating and setting the private key ==
  * In the terminal window enter ssh-keygen -t dss
  * On mist cd to .shh and create an authorization file (vim authorized_keys)
  * On your machine (cat ./ssh/id_dsa.pub)
  * Copy the key and go to mist and paste it into the authorized_keys file
  * Test to see if the login to mist works with username and password
  * If it does that means that the key worked.
  * Then go back to the Netbeans IDE and browse to the ./ssh directory to upload the "id_dsa" file into the private key. 

== Setting up the Hadoop Cluster on Karmasphere ==
  * On the services tab click on Hadoop Clusters
  * Click on New Cluster
  * Enter the cluster name "mistRider"
  * In the "Cluster Type" enter "Hadoop cluster"
  * The default filesystem will point to the filesystem you have created
  * You have to enter the host name (mist.public.stolaf.edu) and port (9001)
  * Press next then enter the proxy type as SSHTUNNEL: and your username and the private key should be autocompleted, if not follow the smae steps as when setting up the filesystem in order to obtain the private key.
  * Press finish
