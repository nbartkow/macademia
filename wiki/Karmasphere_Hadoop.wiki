Karmasphere is a Hadoop plugin for Netbeans. It allows programmers to
interact with the Hadoop filesystem and run jobs. We are using it to
calculate the similarity of our wikipedia pages.

== Installing Karmasphere == 
  * Install Netbeans (http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html -choose the java version)
  * In Netbeans go to plugins  and clique settings
  * On settings click the button add and enter the following information
  * Name: "Karmasphere for Hadoop" and URL: "http://hadoopstudio.org/updates/updates.xml"
  * Click ok and go to available plugins tab and search for karmasphere
  * About four items will appear on the results, click all of them and press install
  
== Checking out the project ==
  * On Netbeans click on team and choose svn
  * Choose checkout and the URL is "http://poliwiki.macalester.edu/svn/research"
  * Enter your username and password and checkout

== Setting up the HDFS service in Netbeans ==
  * On Netbeans click on the services tab
  * Choose Hadoop Filesystems and right click on it
  * Click new filesystem
  * Enter the Filesystem Name "Wikipedia_Hadoop"
  * Click on HDFS and click next
  * Enter the NameNode host "mist.public.stolaf.edu"; port: 9000, your username and group
  * Press next and enter proxy type: "SSH TUNNEL", enter the SSH private key (see next section)
  * Press Finish
  * The new filesystem will appear under Hadoop Filesystems
  * Right click on it and press browse to see files

== Generating and setting the private key ==
  * In the terminal window enter ssh-keygen -t dss
  * On mist cd to .shh and create an authorization file (vim authorized_keys)
  * On your machine (cat ./ssh/id_dsa.pub)
  * Copy the key and go to mist and paste it into the authorized_keys file
  * Test to see if the login to mist works with username and password
  * If it does that means that the key worked.
  * Then go back to the Netbeans IDE and browse to the ./ssh directory to upload the "id_dsa" file into the private key.
